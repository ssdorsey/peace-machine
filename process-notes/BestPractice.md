# Best Practices Guide

The purpose of the present document is to provide a guide for the manual coding exercise. Here, we assume that individuals will be searching for the news themselves instead of the mechanism we proposed last week where we give them the news. 

## 1. Know your country
If this is the first time you conduct research on the country assigned to you, make sure you do some backroung reading first. This way, you can be able to identify certain of the most prominent features of the country, particularly in the last 10 years. You should be able to answer questions like:
* Who is the current president? What is his or her party? Since when he/she has been in power?
* What is the organization of the state? 
* What is the role of the military in the state? The police's role?
* What are the most prominent media outlets?
* How did the current party obtained the presidency?

Answering this types of questions will allow you to start identifying the main actors invovled in your case study. It could be helpful during this first approximation to write in a piece of paper the most prominent events of the country. So you can make a timeline of the events in the period you are analyzing. 

## 2. Choose a news outlet
After you feel comfortable with your overall knowledge of the country and the identification of the actors, it is important to choose a news outlet to start the coding process. There are two ways of doing this:
* **a. Using local media** When using local media, make sure the searching function allows you to filter by date. This would make your life easier and would help with being more systematic. If you know the language, probably you would be able to obtain more information using local media since it would have more local events that might not appear in other webpages.
* **b. Using Google news** Filtering by date in Google news can be done by entering a search parameter and then below the search bar click on tools. A new bar with different option will appear. Click on recent and then on customized interval. Once here, you will be able to define the date you want to see the results of your search.

## 3. Searching for events
We consider that the best mechanism for recovering the events is introducing a series of keywords into the search bar and generating a filter for the periods of time you are interested in looking. It is probably the best approach to use weekly or monthly time periods since those would probably be the frequency of the data we are interested on. Once defined the temporal frame, go through the first 5 pages of search results thoroughly and code the events you find in there. You will notice that during periods of big events, news are going to be somewhat repetitive. Remember that we are interested in the events and not quite in the number of news covering the event. (*MVC: How to deal with events that expand in multiple weeks?*).

Here you can find a list of the main dependent and independent variables you should look for and some suggested keywords:

### Dependent variables/classes of actions:
 **1. Violence/force:**   (police, protests, martial law, violence)
   * Police violence against peaceful protesters
   * Police violence against members of opposition parties/civil society during demonstrations
   * Arrest/violence against journalists
   * Declaration of martial law
   * Violent outbreaks during elections

 **2. Freedom of association & free speech:**    
   * Using defamation cases to silence critics
   * Restrictive internet laws
   * Shutting down social media/internet/websites
   * Laws that restrict the right to assembly
   * Laws that restrict the formation and/or operation of non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations
   * Incarceration of opposition members
   * Changes to media ownership laws that limit competition or allow for consolidation
   * Limit size of groups that can gather in public/tighten regulations on public demonstrations
   * Imposing broadcast bans on media institutions about certain issues (which issues?)
   * Restricting party formation/competition

 ### Independent variables
 **1. Institutional warning signs:**    
   * Packing local courts
   * Packing higher courts such as Supreme Court, State Council, and High Council of Judges and Prosecutors
   * Packing the military or the police forces
   * New laws regulating civil service
   * New laws giving the executive nomination powers
   * Erosion of the autonomy/authority of the electoral commission or electoral authorities.
   * Purging members of the ruling party
   * Extending or eliminating terms limits of chief executive
   * Calling irregular elections or constitutional referenda
   * Rescheduling/Postponing/Cancelling regularly-scheduled elections
   * Appointment of the President’s family members in governmental institutions
   * Changing rules for political competition (i.e. requirements for parties)
   * Increased reliance on executive orders

 **4. Internal/External Threats:**   
   * Declarations of strident nationalism, anti-foreign, anti-U.S., etc.
   * Sudden emphasis on national security/sovereignty concerns
   * Demonization of national/ethnic/religious minorities
   * Demonization of the opposition
   * Anti-“elite” language

 **5. Others:**    
   * Polarization of civil society
   * Increase in demands to international organizations
   * Not allowing international organizations to monitor elections
   * Increased number of corruption cases in the media


## 4. Coding an event
Once we have defined the exact information we want from each one of the news articles. We could present a detailed coding scheme in this section. For now, it is important to identify the date, the URL, the actors involved in the article, a brief description of the event, and code the entry into the defined dependent and independet varaibles explained beforehand. 

## Some additional considerations
* Sometimes the news articles will reference laws that might be interesting to research further since they are some of our independent variables. However, the article might provide just a name for the law and its date thus there is not enough information to look for a more detailed description of the law. Knowing if there is a legislative gazette where you can look for the law might be a good resource. The other, is trying with different combinations of keywords to expand your search.
