The purpose of the present document is to provide a guide for the manual coding exercise. Here, we assume that individuals will be searching for the news themselves instead of the mechanism we proposed last week where we give them the news. 

## 1. Know your country
If this is the first time you conduct research on the country assigned to you, make sure you do some backroung reading first. This way, you can be able to identify certain of the most prominent features of the country, particularly in the last 10 years. You should be able to answer questions like:

## Trying keywords for high-frequency events

Internment of peaceful protestors is one of the high-frequency events
that we can easily come across on a weekly (or even daily ) basis in
Turkey. I basically google searched (in Turkish) using the following three keywords:
"protest, police, custody". And I checked the first 5 results. 4 out of
5 news were relevant for our case (police arresting peaceful protests,
police violence on high school students, police arresting people from an
NGO, police arresting people, including a journalist, who were
supporting workers working under bad conditions in new airport
construction).

Similarly, another high frequency event (Erdogan's defamation cases),
also returned relevant news (using "Erdogan, defamation case,
compensation" as keywords). 2 of the 5 news was about Erdogan opening
new defamation cases against the leadership of main opposition party and
one news was a summary of all defamation cases which aim to punish
people on the grounds of insulting the president (other 2 news were
about main opposition party opening new cases against Erdogan).

## Trying keywords for laws that restrict civic space (low-frequency)

In this case, I could not find the relevant news. I think this stems
from the fact that each so-called reform changes some specific law.
Although we aggregate them under the heading as "laws that restrict
civic space", I had difficulty in finding a specific "reform" about a
specific law. For instance, we know that a law has passed on 15 February
2014 in Turkey, decreasing the independence of high council of judges
and prosecutors. Assuming that we do not know the date, I tried the
following keywords: "reform, high council of judges and prosecutors". I
could not find the relevant news. I believe that this is because of the
type of the event: although they can be high frequent once aggregated as
"laws restricting civic space", they are hard to find on a case by case
basis. We can either increase the number of keywords to find them or
look at the specific repositories for laws. For Turkey, each law is
announced in official gazette. Once we spot a change in some law of
interest, we can go and check the news of the date when this change
happens and search for the news about this law around that time.
