Rights groups say press freedom in Tanzania has drastically deteriorated since the election in 2015 of President John Magufuli, whose administration has shut down newspapers, arrested opposition leaders and activists and restricted political rallies. The government has rejected the criticism.
Erick Kabendera, who has written for national and international publications, including The Guardian and The Times of London, was arrested at his home in Dar es Salaam last week, over what police said at the time were issues concerning his citizenship.
On Monday afternoon, a court charged Kabendera with three counts of leading organised crime, failure to pay taxes and money laundering, according to a charge sheet seen by Reuters.
In the charge sheet, the State Prosecutor alleged that between January 2015 and July 2019 Kabendera “knowingly furnished assistance in the conduct of affairs of a criminal racket, with intent either to reap profit or other benefit.”
During a similar period, he failed to pay taxes to an income of 173 million shillings ($75,000), the charge sheet said.
The case has been adjourned until August 19 when it will come up for mention.
“Based on the nature of questions he has been asked since being put under police custody, we believe that his arrest and subsequent prosecution are linked to his work as a journalist,” Kabendera’s lawyer, Jebra Kambole, told Reuters.
Government spokesman Hassan Abbasi declined to respond directly to the lawyer’s accusations, saying: “If he is charged in court then let’s leave the matter before the court of law.”
Last month Kabendera published a story in the regional publication The East African about purported internal divisions within the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party ahead of presidential polls in 2020.
Muthoki Mumo, the Sub-Saharan Africa representative for
New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, said the charges were retaliation for Kabendera’s work as a journalist.
“The continued detention of this freelance journalist is an attempt to muzzle a critical voice and his case also has the potential to intimidate others in Tanzania’s media community into silence,” she said.
Kabendera’s lawyer said that money laundering was not a bailable offence, meaning the journalist would have to remain in remand prison until his case was concluded, warning this could be for up to three years.

Murithi Mutiga at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group also said the government was “abusing the charges of economic crimes to target critics, secure in the knowledge that the offence is not bailable.”
“The fact the authorities have offered wildly contrasting justifications for holding Erick leaves no room for doubt that this is a politically motivated attempt to silence one of Tanzania’s most courageous and talented journalists.”

Simiyu. Companies and individuals can verify the authenticity of a tax stamp on various products by using their smartphones, the government has said.
The move seeks to ensure that only products with genuine stamps find their way into the market as the government strives to boost revenue collection through the use of Electronic Tax Stamps (ETS).
The commissioner for policy analysis in the ministry of Finance and Planning, Mr Mgonya Benedicto, told The Citizen here yesterday that a decision to allow individuals and companies to verify the authenticity of the tax stamps on products was meant to control unscrupulous manufacturers and traders who were posting fake stamps on their products, a development that was denying the government lots of money.
“Everyone with a smartphone will be able to verify if the stamp embedded in the product is valid and is from TRA. This will help control counterfeit stamps and thus increase government revenue through various taxes,” he said.
The government embarked on the use of ETS last year in the endeavour to obtain production data in real time from the manufacturers.
The move helps the government to curb revenue leakages and also helps the government to determine in advance the amount of taxes that will be paid.
So far, the ETS – which is being rolled out by a Swiss firm, Société Industrielle et Commerciale de Produits Alimentaires (SICPA) – has registered a number of benefits to the government, with TRA reporting that the recent increase in tax collections was partly due to the system, a taxpayer education and services from Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Mr Godfrey Kumwembe said yesterday.
“With the ETS, we are able to know the real rate of production and the tax rate,” he told journalists here at Nyakabindi grounds during the ongoing farmers’ exhibitions, commonly known as Nane Nane.
The government rolled out Phase Two (2) of Electronic Tax Stamps (ETS) on Thursday, August 1, 2019.
The TRA Commissioner General, Dr Edwin Mhede announced through a newspaper advertisement recently that in line with Regulations 29 of the ETS 2018, the second phase of the project would be rolled out on products such as sweetened or flavoured waters and other non alcoholic beverages with the exclusion of vegetable juices which has a tariff heading 20.09 according to the taxman’s classifications.
“The date is announced, well in advance, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 29 of the Electronic Tax Stamps Regulations, 2018 and that the specified products shall include all locally produced or imported…,” he said the statement.
He said TRA will announce the date for rolling out ETS on other items that have not yet been announced on a later day.
The items will include fruit or vegetable juices, water, films and music.",https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/business/Verification-of-tax-stamps-viable-over-mobile-phone-possible/1840414-5229084-i556b7/index.html,,,"Verification of tax stamps viable over mobile phone possible.

Mbeya. The government has proposed new measures to tackle the scourge of reckless driving and reduce road traffic accidents.
Among the key elements of regulations on the cards is a national database of drivers, which will be used to check competence and ensure traceability.
The Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications yesterday held a meeting with transport stakeholders during which the new measures were tabled.
Mr Haroun Kisaka, director of transport services in the ministry, said the main aim of the proposed new regulations is to address the biggest problems on Tanzanian roads -- incompetent, reckless and illegal drivers.
He said: “The new system will help the authorities assess the competence of drivers, and at the same time relieves owners of commercial vehicles the burdent of preventable penalties.”
The regulations will govern operations of the Land Transport Regulatory Authority (Latra).
Cases of drivers running away after causing accidents on highways are not uncommon in the country. Tracing them is a headache for the Police.
“Previously, the Surface and Marine Transport Authority (Sumatra) used to condemn vehicle owners for the mistakes of a driver who escapes an accident scene or flouts traffic regulations,” Mr Kisaka said.
The proposed database will ensure every commercial driver has a proper licence and job contracts.
Held in Mbeya, yesterday’s meeting was about reviewing a draft on transport regulations and laws with the aim of improving the transport sector in the country and increasing employment opportunities for drivers.",https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/New-road-traffic-laws-target-reckless--illegal-drivers/1840340-5252908-132lo8m/index.html,,,"New road traffic laws target reckless, illegal drivers.

In yesterday’s case, this columnist, however, went a tangent off the mark. I veered off and instead quoted out of context, Mr John Ulanga, the country director of Trade Mark East Africa.
It was an inadvertent anomaly for a piece whose arguments were largely mine. I take the earliest opportunity to unreservedly apologise to Mr Ulanga for portraying him in that unsanctioned light.
There is no doubt that the Tanzanian government is implementing reforms that will ease the Doing Business Environment in the country.
Recent meetings by leading government actors with representatives of the business community are testimony to the understanding of the role of business community in national development.
It is this understanding that has led to many called for changes right from cabinet to state statutory organisations to ensure that the private sector thrives.
Drive the point home
In fact, the idea of ‘its not business as usual’ for bureaucrats in government has been a common mantra to drive the point home.
Similarly, it will be foolhardy not to acknowledge investments in trillions of shillings in infrastructure development with the potential to unlock the economy in a significant way going forward.
Matters to relook into policies that were in conflict with the aspirations of a market-led economy continue to be dealt with, taking into consideration recommendations collected from a wide array of actors. A big step has been seen in efforts to merge duplicate, or sometimes conflicting roles of various statutory bodies.
What does the future therefore portent for investment?
It is obvious that steps taken to take away the revenue collection need from regulatory authority will add much needed impetus and place competition in proper pedestal, which can only add value to the consumer.
The idea that we need a metamorphosis is therefore something that needs to be internalised by all actors and players.
Those in government need to understand that the private sector does and will continue to be the largest employer.
If the government does keep its bargain, there is no doubt that the Doing Business Environment will improve and make investment undoubtedly attractive.

The trustee is under a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of the beneficiary when dealing with the trust property, failing which the trustee is legally accountable for any damage to the beneficiary’s interests.
Forming a trust is a huge life decision, but the nitty-gritties of trust creation are fairly straightforward.
Although it may be possible to create a trust orally, broadly, trusts are created by way of a ‘deed of trust’ or ‘trust deed’, which should be custom-made to meet the specific purpose of the trust.
In Tanzania, trusts are governed by the Trustees’ Incorporation Act, Cap 318 [R.E.2002] which has recently been amended by the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 3) Act, 2019 in order to, inter lia, exclude an NGO, a company, a society, a trade union, an agricultural association, a political party, a sports association/club, a microfinance group (VICOBA), a cooperative society and any trust which the minister responsible for legal affairs may declare not to be a trust for the purpose of the Act from the definition of the term “trust”.
Nevertheless, besides the Trustees’ Incorporation Act, Cap 318, other pieces of legislation (such as, the Income Tax Act, 2004, and the Tax Administration Act, 2015) impact the existence and operation of the trusts in Tanzania.
The evolution of trusts all over the world remains demand-led, yet the Trustees’ Incorporation Act, Cap 318 as an enactment is archaic both in time and in substance in the context of the modern developments concerning trusts.
Furthermore, for its implementing rules, the Trustees’ Incorporation Act, Cap 318 still relies on the Trustees’ Incorporation Rules, 1956.
The inflexibility of the legal framework for trusts in Tanzania to accommodate trailblazing trust devices in present-day financial and legal practice and more dynamic relationships among the settlor, trustee and beneficiary means that extant Tanzanian trusts lag behind in providing a more appropriate and effective wealth and succession planning mechanism for Tanzanian family assets.
What is more, the legal framework triflingly jettisons the fears and concerns of potential settlors to lose control over trust properties transferred to rascal trustees whose motivations do not support the common good.
Some of the trailblazing trust devices developed by many of the world’s fastest-growing economies in recent years include, but are not limited to: Directed Trust, Trust Protector, Special Purpose Entity, Family Advisor, and Trust Matter Privacy. These devices deliver far more flexibility and control to settlors and beneficiaries and their advisers to modify and influence key aspects of the trust and provide direction to trustees with regard to investment management and trust distributions.
Consequently, some Tanzanian settlors may elect to hold and plan their family assets through trust arrangements set up in foreign countries.
There is a general belief in Tanzania that trusts are used for tax planning purposes.
But in actuality, trusts are a great tool for managing family assets since, unlike a will, they work during one’s lifetime and the trust deed can be changed to meet the specific intentions of the settlor and the ongoing needs of the beneficiaries.
Moreover, irrespective of the demise of the settlor, the trust property is able to remain within the trust for the life of the trust which may span many generations.
In keeping with its position as a major gateway to the African continent, Tanzania cannot isolate itself from the global trend toward modernizing antiquated laws and rules governing trusts.
Unless specifically exempted, trusts are subject to tax separately from their beneficiaries under section 52 of the Income Tax Act, 2004.
Trusts are, therefore, a potential revenue source for the government, but they remain largely unexploited.

Dar es Salaam. Tanzania needs to overcome huge data gaps to meet an ambitious set of global goals to conquer poverty, inequality and other international woes by a 2030 deadline, policy analysts have said.
At a breakfast debate in Dar es Salaam yesterday, analysts noted that progress is not moving fast enough to meet the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs-2030).
The theme of the debate was ‘From Policy to Action Frameworks: How can Agenda 2030 for SDGs be Achieved in Tanzania?’
Analysts raised concerns over reports that the country was able to collect only 40 per cent of the data required to effectively monitor implementation of the goals.
This is revealed in the first publication of the civil society -supported Voluntary National Review (VNR) report for 2019.
The discrepancy is largely attributed to the existing challenges relating to the level of data disaggregation; frequency of data production; incomplete data sets and data quality - particularly regarding administrative statistics.

Other challenges - the report says - have something to do with unreliable routine data collection systems; lack of interoperable data management systems within national statistical platforms; policy incoherence, and inadequate resource mobilisation.
The director for Population Census and Social Statistics at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Ms Ruth Minja, said there is a major problem regarding data availability at the national, regional, district and ward levels.
“Data availability remains as one of the main stumbling blocks in informing about the implementation, follow-ups and review of the global Sustainable Development Goals in the country,” she stressed.
She mentioned some of the goals that were severely affected by the exiting data gaps in tracking progress as including SDG Number Eight (Decent work and economic growth); Goal Number 13 (Climate action), and Goal Number 16 (Peace, Justice and strong institutions).
In stark contrast to that, she mentioned Goals Number Three (good health and general well-being) and Number Four quality education) as areas, whose data was readily available.
Apart from data gaps, other challenges that do arise, as a matter of course, are the absence of clear coordination mechanisms on sustainable development; policy incoherence, and unclear linkages among different sectors.
“Despite the prevailing challenges, our report was ranked among the best - whereby some African countries are already requesting to learn from us,” she said.
In the event, the NBS director named Malawi as one of the countries seeking to take a leaf out of Tanzania’s book on the SDGs development programme in general, and how to prepare ‘Voluntary National Review’ reports in particular.
As per Ms Minja, the NBS is improving its ways of collecting data at both the central and local government levels.
The ministry of Finance and Planning is also initiating a Coordination Framework that is designed to ensure that the government works closely with the private sector and civil society organizations.
Commenting on the matter, a policy analyst at the ministry, Mr Francis Shirima, said “currently, it is hard to meet with other development stakeholders and engage in implementing the SDGs. With the envisaged coordination framework - which is in the final stages of preparation - we will be able to more effectively communicate and organise with other non-governmental entities,” has stated.
Up-dates of the implementation of the SDGs will be included in the Annual Development Reports, Mr Shirima revealed.
For his part, a member of the Tanzania Sustainable Development Platform (TSDP), Mr Stephen Chacha, lamented that the pace of implementation of the SDGs is still low - and that, as a consequence, there is a real possibility of Tanzania failing to achieve them as targeted.
“Tanzania has mainly been focusing on the quantity aspect when implementing the goals. But, the SDGs are focused more on quality. For instance, in the quality education aspect, the government has phenomenally increased enrolments in schools. However, the quality of the education being provided remains pathetically low,” Mr Chacha pointed out.",https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/Plug-data-gap-to-meet-goals-on-development--government-told/1840340-5255566-ynt0jf/index.html,,,"Plug data gap to meet goals on development, government told.

Unreliable job opportunities have forced youths to venture into seeking mobile slots on websites to generate additional income to the insecure job.
This was said by Edgar Mwampige the Founder and CEO of Worknasi a new startup which brings opportunity to residential and commercial property owners to make income.
“The question of unemployment has different perspectives related to particular social and economic system of a country. Worse still, there is no any standard instrument and mechanisms for measuring the seriousness of joblessness”. He says.
This means mobile opportunities are increasingly in demand. However there are no enough readily available and affordable spaces to work and meet”. He says
Founder talking about Worknasi is an online platform (Web and Mobile App) for searching, exploring, listing, renting, booking and sharing co-working spaces, private full serviced offices, meeting rooms and anything in between work spaces in Africa.
Whether you are looking to list, rent or book a hot desk, private office spaces, open desk, private office room or a meeting room and other available services to transform their work place spaces and start earning addition income.
“With our mobile App, you can easily discover a work place nearby your area by simply opening the App and will automatically locate a nearby co-working space or shared office nearby you. You can instant book or rent the space as per your need whether you want to use it for a day, week or month”. He says.
He says paying for the work spaces or meeting room has been made easy. You can opt to pay by mobile money or card of your choice.
“For the office and meeting room owners, Worknasi is more than just a platform to list your space and go. We give you the tools to help you manage your space/meeting room, communicate with the members of your space and analytics tool to understand the business performance of your space in real time”. He says.
Edgar says after helping people access office spaces and meeting rooms, we connect them with freelancers.
Whether they are corporates, startups or individuals who want to work with professional freelancers across Africa, you can easily find freelancers suitable for your project or you can easily post your projects and receive bids.
He said adding that startup will help people to manage their project easily through your dashboard on their computer or on the go by using our Mobile Application. You can learn more about this on our how it works.
Edgar says he once owned a transporting company whose customers forced him to think of having a reliable office, hinting that in the first place it was a bit hard to convince people to do their work.
“I told my uncle that I miss huge tenders with a lot of money over lack of a reliable office. He responded to my cry and found me a space, thanks to customers who are used to it currently,” he says.
Edgar says he came up with an idea of establishing a platform where people who need office spaces for conference could easily get along with him.
“Job opportunities are slim in our country. This mobile app has come in the hour of need People can use their mobile phones to look for a nearby office spaces, conference meeting and the freelance services,” says Edgar adding….
“Example if you have your own mobile phone and have arrived in Kenya looking for an office, you can switch on our app immediately and find one.”
Edgar says freelance accountants, journalists and any other professionals can easily benefit from the app while seeking job opportunities.
Talking about the challenges, Albert Secha Operation leader and co –founder says since they started the application capital has been their major constraint.
He notes that in the first place it was difficult to operate because they were in need of recruiting members who are competent in information technology.
Secha who is telecom engineering by profession and his co-founder a lawyer says the company has recently addressed the shortage of IT professionals, thanks to colleges that churn out a good number of experts annually.
Edgar says they have been able to soldier on despite the ups and downs for eight solid months, which he finds to be a significant stride.",https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/magazine/success/Technology-now-brings-work-space-to-your-location/1843788-5229488-3u4wxuz/index.html,,,"Technology now brings work space to your location.

Dar es Salaam. Former African presidents have called on governments across the continent to include the protection of natural resources in school curricula.
The proposal is one of the recommendations made yesterday in Dar es Salaam at the end of the African Leadership Forum.
“I’m glad to see there is common understanding that natural resources in this continent and our seas are ours. We tend to talk and write about them as if they belong to those who exploiting them…those who colonised us….which is not the case,” said former President of Tanzania Mr Benjamin Mkapa who was the chairman of the forum.
The leaders called for joining of efforts to protect the continental natural resources. They also recommended the governments to invest in researches that will come up with solutions for the current challenges facing the resources. Speakers raised the question of whether Africa is aware of its potentials and propose that aggressive campaigns were needed to both citizenry and political leaders on how to protect the natural resources.
The leaders met with executives from multinational organisations, academia, private sector and the civil society ended their two-day sessions. The forum focused on forests, water and land without drifting into mineral and petroleum resources.
Prof Andrew Temu who presented the summary of the discussions and recommendations said the forum resolved the continent leaders to know that the solution for African resource challenges were on the hands of Africans themselves and not from external.

Dar es Salaam. The sedition case against the former Singida East Tundu Lissu and other three has been adjourned to September 23, 2019 due to absence of the first accused, who is undergoing medical treatment in Belgium.
The other co-accused includes editors of Mawio newspaper Mr Simon Mkina and Jabir Idrisa and director of Jamana Printers Mr Ismael Mehboob.
Mr Lissu was shot by unknown people in September 2017, while he was attending parliamentary session in Tanzania’s capital Dodoma and he has is currently in Belgium for treatment.
The state attorney Sylivia Mitando, on Thursday August 22, 2019 told the senior resident magistrate Thomas Simba that the case had come for mention, but she asked for another date due to absence of Mr Tundu Lissu.
Following the request, the magistrate ruled out that the case will be mentioned on September 23 this year.

Dar es Salaam. Police outlawed a meeting organised by opposition ACT-Wazalendo in Temeke District yesterday.
The meeting in Azimio Ward was the second the police blocked in recent weeks, sparking outrage from the Zitto Kabwe led opposition party.
Drama ensued soon after various leaders, including the party’s adviser, Mr Seif Sharif Hamad and secretary general Dorothy Semi arrived at a hall in the ward for the event. ACT-Wazalendo regional publicity secretary Ray Matata told journalists who had arrived to cover that the party had sent a notice to the authorities.
This reporter witnessed two police vehicles arrive at the Sunrise Hall and ordered party supporters who had gathered there to disperse, saying their gathering had not followed the right procedures.
Some of the journalists who attempted to photograph the unfolding events were intercepted and forced onto the vehicles, alongside ACT Wazalendo supporters who were arrested.
After hours of exchange, party supporters decided to vacate the area and went back to the party’s ward office.
“The meeting was above board because the police had all the information. Why did they leave us to go ahead and pay for the meeting hall if they knew we hadn’t followed the procedures?” queried Mr Ray Matata.
He blamed the issue on double standards, claiming that other parties have been holding meetings without even a permit.",https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/1840340-5248394-9ar819/index.html,,,"Police block another ACT Dar meeting.
