Glenn Greenwald: Brazil accuses journalist of cyber-crimes,"Brazilian authorities are seeking to bring charges against Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who published Edward Snowden's intelligence agency leaks. Mr Greenwald has been accused of ""helping guiding and encouraging"" a criminal group that hacked into the phones of Brazilian officials. The journalist had recently published stories describing private messages between public prosecutors. At this point, federal public prosecutors have proposed the charges. However, a judge still needs to decide whether to formally indict him. Six other individuals have also been accused of illegal telephone interceptions and conspiracy among other related crimes. Brazilian prosecutors allege that, during his interactions with the group, Mr Greenwald advised its members to delete messages that they had passed on to him. Mr Greenwald has not yet publicly responded to this particular allegation. Last year, Mr Greenwald and colleagues published a series of ten investigative reports on news site The Intercept, which detailed ""a massive trove of previously undisclosed materials"" allegedly by Brazilian prosecutors and other officials.

Guatemala seeks arrest of former attorney general Thelma Aldana,"A judge in Guatemala has issued an arrest warrant for the country's former attorney general, Thelma Aldana, who is a current presidential candidate. Ms Aldana, 63, who is currently out of the country, is wanted on charges of embezzlement, lying and tax fraud. She has denied any wrongdoing. Ms Aldana has worked closely with a UN-backed anti-corruption commission to try to impeach President Jimmy Morales. Guatemala said last month it was withdrawing from the commission. Mr Morales initially supported the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) when he was elected three years ago. The mandate of the UN-backed body has helped prosecutors bring cases against dozens of senior officials and executives. But when Mr Morales became the subject of investigations by the commission into campaign financing, the president said he would review its mandate. Ms Aldana was Guatemala's most senior prosecutor from 2014 to 2018. During that time she prosecuted and jailed the former president Otto Perez Molina, as well as other politicians, on corruption charges. The warrant for her arrest was issued by Judge Victor Cruz on Tuesday - the same day she was registered as a presidential candidate. It relates to a corruption inquiry involving illegal hiring, a Supreme Court official said. Police spokesman Jorge Aguilar said Ms Aldana was ""currently travelling"". ""There is a migratory alert out because we know she is not in the country,"" he said. The CICIG had sought to prosecute Mr Morales, who was a comedian before becoming president in 2016, over allegations of funding irregularities linked to his 2015 election campaign.

Uttar Pradesh: India state begins enacting controversial citizenship law," India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, has begun identifying illegal migrants who might be eligible for citizenship under a controversial law. State minister Shrikant Sharma told reporters that the government had identified around 32,000 people in 21 of the state's 80 districts. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) offers citizenship to non-Muslims from three nearby Muslim-majority countries. Violent protests against it have killed 30 people in Uttar Pradesh alone. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government says the CAA will protect people from persecution, but critics say it's part of a ""Hindu nationalist"" drive to marginalise India's more than 200 million Muslims. Adding to the fears is a government pledge to carry out a widespread exercise to weed out ""infiltrators"" from neighbouring countries. Given that the exercise relies on extensive documentation to prove that their ancestors lived in India, many Muslim citizens fear that they could be made stateless.",Uttar Pradesh,state,,,illegal migrants,controversial citizenship law,,,," India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, has begun identifying illegal migrants who might be eligible for citizenship under a controversial law."," India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, has begun identifying illegal migrants who might be eligible for citizenship under a controversial law.

Kashmir blackout eases but restrictions remain,"Mobile internet and social media remain largely blocked in Indian-administered Kashmir, despite a partial easing of curbs imposed when the government revoked its special status in August. Limited broadband service returned to the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, while 2G mobile coverage resumed in parts of Hindu-majority Jammu. Internet services were suspended across the region on 4 August. India said the move was necessary to maintain law and order. The Kashmir valley is the site of a long-running insurgency against Indian rule. A security crackdown and restrictions on communications were among measures imposed as India revoked the region's semi-autonomous status and split it into two federally-administered territories. The government said the internet could be used to spread disinformation and allow militant groups to plan attacks. But critics called the shutdown - the longest ever in any democracy - undemocratic and draconian. The chief US diplomat for South Asia affairs, Alice Wells, is among those who have expressed concern. ""We remain concerned by detention of political leaders and residents, and internet restrictions. We look forward to a return to normalcy,"" she tweeted on Saturday, days after India arranged a tour of the region for some diplomats.

'Attempt to crush independent media' in Bangladesh,"It can seem a bit self-righteous when journalists write about the importance of freedom of the press, a bit like a chef celebrating the virtues of a fancy meal or a hairdresser extolling the importance of a new haircut.

But the public's right to know what is really going on in their country really is the cornerstone of a free society.

Without free access to information, backed up by journalists who are willing to dig down and get to the truth, all the other liberties celebrated in democracies are endangered.

That's why the world should be worried by the concerted attacks on one of the leading newspaper editors in South Asia, Mahfuz Anam of Bangladesh's Daily Star.

The Daily Star is the most popular English-language newspaper in Bangladesh.

It was launched as Bangladesh returned to parliamentary democracy a quarter of a century ago, and has always had a reputation for journalistic integrity and liberal and progressive views - a kind of Bangladeshi New York Times.

That's why it is so shocking that Mr Anam now stands accused of treason, no less.

Sajeeb Wajed, the son of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has described him as ""completely unethical"" and a liar, and has demanded he be thrown in jail.

Mr Wajed is at the head of a queue of dozens of politicians, student agitators and others who have launched criminal defamation charges against the eminent editor.

I will go into the details of the allegations against Mr Anam in a moment, but first it is important that the claims are set in context, because it is hard not to see this as the latest line of attack in a concerted effort to gag one of the last independent media organisations in the country.

True Federalism: Southern governors must work together  – Ambode,"[""Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State says southern governors must come together to resolve issues of common interest.

Extracts from his address:"",""We will recall that the maiden gathering of this forum was held in 2001 at the Akodo Beach Resort, Ibeju Lekki, here in Lagos."",""The initiative to set up the SGF was received with mixed feelings at the time. There were those who read partisan political moves into the idea. Others saw it as essentially sectional and potentially divisive while some dismissed the SGF as another superfluous talk shop of doubtful utility."",""However, the convener of the inaugural edition of the forum and my illustrious predecessor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, gave a robust articulation of the necessity for the forum in his address to participants, which remains relevant and pertinent even today. On that occasion he said, “We are of course aware that our northern brothers have met regularly and publicly articulated common positions of interest in the polity. While some have condemned such meetings, I believe very strongly that such fora should indeed be actively encouraged and supported. Our democracy and federal system can only be strengthened when various groups and component parts of the country are free to discuss and pursue their perceived common aspirations within the framework of the law."",""There are unquestionably issues of common interest to us as governors of states in the southern region of Nigeria. This does not mean that there are no matters which the South-West, the South-East, or the South-South, respectively, may feel constrained to pursue separately at other fora”."",""From its modest beginning in 2001, the SGF held at least nine meetings over the following four years with the last one taking place again in Lagos on Friday, 25th  February, 2005. During this period, the forum became a significant voice on matters of critical import both to the south and to Nigeria as a whole."",""Perhaps, we need to quickly remind ourselves some of the landmark achievements obtained through the pressure exerted by this forum in the past. The first was its collective advocacy for the special allocation to oil producing states in the federation account which resulted in the current formula of 13% accruing for Derivation in allocating revenues from the Federation Account."",""Another major victory won towards strengthening the country’s practice of true federalism was the declaration by the Supreme Court in 2002 that the then prevalent practice of the federal government deducting monies from the Federation Account as a first line charge for the funding of Joint Venture Contracts, NNPC priority projects, servicing of Federal Government’s external debt, the judiciary and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and other federal obligations were illegal and unconstitutional."",""The Supreme Court in that case abolished the special funds created by the Federal Government to enable it draw funds from the Federation Account to pay for matters that fell within its exclusive responsibility before sharing whatever was left with the states and local governments."",""Despite these successes, there is still a lot to be done. There is certainly a lot to be done about true federalism; an issue that requires urgent, meticulous and proactive attention by this forum."",""o less disturbing is the failure to undertake the periodic review of the revenue allocation formula as provided for by the constitution to reflect evolving realities. This is another critical matter that ought to engage this forum in order to enhance the viability of the states and local governments as well as their capacity to fulfill their developmental roles in the polity. All too often, states are disparaged for always carrying begging bowls to Abuja in quest of hand-outs from the federal government."",""This is a function of our present national constitution that burdens the federal government with activities and responsibilities that rightly fall within the province of the states. The productivity and revenue-generating capacities of most of the states are thus stifled thus turning them into no better than street beggar states incapable of even meeting routine obligations of paying workers’ salaries and pensions without federal support."",""Lagos State has fought and won several legal battles since 1999 that has systematically strengthened her autonomy and enhanced her fiscal viability. Over the years, the state has won legal control over the management of its environment, control of urban and physical planning, regulation of overhead masts, registration and regulation of hotels and restaurants and control of her inland waterways. And these victories do not belong to Lagos alone, but to all other states in the federation and which they must explore significantly."",""I believe that If Lagos has been able to achieve so much fighting singly, the SGF can accomplish much more by thinking, planning, strategizing and acting together."",""This resuscitation of the SGF is coming at a most appropriate time. As we are aware, the Senate and House of Representatives are currently harmonizing their differences on the proposed amendments to the 1999 constitution before they are transmitted to the state Houses of Assembly for approval. It is important for this forum to comprehensively look at the proposed amendments with a view to working with our respective Houses of Assembly to ensure a coordinated response on our part that will strengthen the practice of democracy, federalism, constitutionalism and the rule of law."",""In our deliberations, particularly on the pressing need for greater devolution of powers, responsibilities and resources from the centre to the states, our preoccupation must not be with having a weak centre and strong states or vice versa.

Somalia's al Shabaab vows huge blast in Kenya,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia’s al Shabaab rebels called on Thursday for supporters in Kenya to carry out a major strike in retaliation for a 12-day military incursion by east Africa’s powerhouse. Kenya has sent soldiers and heavy weapons into southern Somalia to crush the al Qaeda-linked militants Nairobi blames for a string of kidnappings on Kenyan soil and frequent border incursions. Kenyan units have advanced on several fronts with Somali government troops and allied militias toward al Shabaab strongholds and a fighter jet bombed its port city of Kismayu on Sunday. “The time to ask Kenya to stop war has passed. The only option is to fight them. Kenya, you have started the war and so you have to face the consequences,” Sheikh Muktar Robow Abu Mansoor, a top al Shabaab official, told a demonstration. Kenyan military spokesman Emmanuel Chirchir told Reuters their forces clashed with al Shabaab fighters in southern Somalia, east of a town called Tabda, on Thursday and two wounded soldiers had been evacuated. “There was action today between al Shabaab and our forces. We managed to kill nine al Shabaab,” he said. An al Shabaab spokesman, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, told Reuters his fighters had ambushed four Kenyan military vehicles near Tabda. He did not give details of any casualties. The al Shabaab official urged sympathizers in Kenya to shun the grenade attacks that hit the capital Nairobi on Monday, killing one person and wounding 29. Police said on Thursday that all but six of the victims had now returned home. “The Kenyan Mujahideen who were trained by Osama in Afghanistan, stop throwing grenades at buses. We need a huge blow against Kenya. Hand grenades hurled can harm them but we want huge blasts,” he told hundreds of people gathered in Elasha, near Mogadishu. Residents said al Shabaab had ordered them on Wednesday to close businesses and attend the anti-Kenyan rallies.",Somalia's al Shabaab rebels,Shabaab,,,supporters in Kenya,huge blast in Kenya,,,,MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia’s al Shabaab rebels called on Thursday for supporters in Kenya to carry out a major strike in retaliation for a 12-day military incursion by east Africa’s powerhouse.,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia’s al Shabaab rebels called on Thursday for supporters in Kenya to carry out a major strike in retaliation for a 12-day military incursion by east Africa’s powerhouse.

The BJP-BJD alliance ended after 11 years in a dispute over seat sharing in forthcoming elections, leaving the BJD without a majority.

Hundreds of US-bound migrants stopped from entering Mexico,"The migrants, mainly from Honduras, took to the water after being refused permission to cross a nearby bridge.

The security forces fired tear gas to force the migrants back and rounded up those who managed to make it across.

Mexico has cut off migration routes to the US under pressure from President Donald Trump.

National Guard troops with riot shields were seen trying to stop the migrants from climbing the banks of the Suchiate river, which marks the border between Mexico and Guatemala.

Some of those who were trying to reach Mexico threw stones at the police.

The detained migrants have been transferred to immigration stations. They will be returned to their home countries if their legal status cannot be resolved, the government said. The migrants had been camped out in the Guatemalan town of Tecún Umán, across the border from Mexico's Ciudad Hidalgo.

Eight representatives of the migrants were allowed into Mexico for talks with the authorities and to pass a letter on to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

They urged him to let them pass and promised to respect the law. Those who tried to cross the river on Monday were part of a 2,000 to 3,500-strong group dubbed ""2020 Caravan"", evoking previous attempts to cross Mexico en masse to reach the US border.

For its part, Guatemala said several thousand migrants had crossed into its territory from Honduras since Wednesday. Many of the migrants on the Mexico border said they were fleeing violence, poverty and high murder rates.

""We got desperate because of the heat. It's been exhausting, especially for the children,"" Honduran migrant Elvis Martínez told AFP news agency.

Mexico has said they can stay and work in Mexico and apply for asylum but will not be allowed free passage to the US.

Rio violence: Police killings reach record high in 2019,"The number of police killings in Rio de Janeiro reached a record high last year, officials say, amid controversial hardline measures to tackle violence. Last year, opposition parliamentarian Renata Souza, head of the Human Rights Commission at Rio State Assembly, called on the United Nations to investigate the police operations, and UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet raised concerns about the increase in killings by the police.

Police killed 1,810 people, an average of five per day, the highest number since official records began in 1998.

Critics blame the rise on policies that include the use of heavily armed agents and helicopter-borne snipers to fight criminals in densely populated areas.

But officials say the approach has worked, citing a drop in violent crime.

Rio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent states and vast areas are under the control of criminals, many of them linked to powerful drug-trafficking gangs. But paramilitary groups formed by active and retired policemen, known as milícias, have also expanded their influence in recent years. Police raids increased last year as Governor Wilson Witzel employed what critics describe as a policy of confrontation. A conservative former judge and marine, Mr Witzel took office in January 2019 after saying the authorities would ""dig graves"" to bury criminals if necessary and vowing to ""slaughter"" any armed suspect.

The total of police killings recorded last year represents an 18% increase on the previous year, according to Rio de Janeiro's state government.

While officials say most of the victims were gunmen who died in confrontations with police, there are suspicions that some cases were extrajudicial killings. In others, innocent people were wrongfully targeted or died in the crossfire. Meanwhile, the number of homicides in the state fell to 3,995, the lowest number since records began in 1991. The drop mirrors a trend seen across Brazil, where homicides fell more than 20% in the first nine months of last year, official data shows.

Experts say this is a result of a number of factors, including truce deals between rival criminal groups, the transfer of gang members to safer federal prisons, better state policing strategies and the improvement of Brazil's economy after years of crisis.

Mr Witzel - who has expressed a wish to run for the presidency of Brazil - celebrated the numbers on Twitter, saying his policies were ""generating positive results month after month"". Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain who also defends the use of force against suspects, has repeatedly said that ""a good criminal is a dead criminal"". He and Mr Witzel have supported changes in legislation that would protect officers from prosecution if they kill suspects.

Last year, opposition parliamentarian Renata Souza, head of the Human Rights Commission at Rio State Assembly, called on the United Nations to investigate the police operations, and UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet raised concerns about the increase in killings by the police.

Police killed 1,810 people, an average of five per day, the highest number since official records began in 1998.

Critics blame the rise on policies that include the use of heavily armed agents and helicopter-borne snipers to fight criminals in densely populated areas.

But officials say the approach has worked, citing a drop in violent crime.

Rio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent states and vast areas are under the control of criminals, many of them linked to powerful drug-trafficking gangs. But paramilitary groups formed by active and retired policemen, known as milícias, have also expanded their influence in recent years. Police raids increased last year as Governor Wilson Witzel employed what critics describe as a policy of confrontation. A conservative former judge and marine, Mr Witzel took office in January 2019 after saying the authorities would ""dig graves"" to bury criminals if necessary and vowing to ""slaughter"" any armed suspect.

The total of police killings recorded last year represents an 18% increase on the previous year, according to Rio de Janeiro's state government.

While officials say most of the victims were gunmen who died in confrontations with police, there are suspicions that some cases were extrajudicial killings. In others, innocent people were wrongfully targeted or died in the crossfire. Meanwhile, the number of homicides in the state fell to 3,995, the lowest number since records began in 1991. The drop mirrors a trend seen across Brazil, where homicides fell more than 20% in the first nine months of last year, official data shows.

Experts say this is a result of a number of factors, including truce deals between rival criminal groups, the transfer of gang members to safer federal prisons, better state policing strategies and the improvement of Brazil's economy after years of crisis.

Mr Witzel - who has expressed a wish to run for the presidency of Brazil - celebrated the numbers on Twitter, saying his policies were ""generating positive results month after month"". Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain who also defends the use of force against suspects, has repeatedly said that ""a good criminal is a dead criminal"". He and Mr Witzel have supported changes in legislation that would protect officers from prosecution if they kill suspects.

Syria war: Jihadist assault 'kills dozens of soldiers',"Up to 40 Syrian soldiers have been killed in an assault by hundreds of militants in north-western Syria, according to Russia's defence ministry.

The ministry, which supports Syria's government, said there were several attacks in which the militants seized two settlements in Idlib province. Meanwhile, rescue workers reported that Russian air strikes killed at least eight civilians across the region on Thursday.

The Syria Civil Defence, whose volunteers are known as the White Helmets, said a women and her two children had died in the village of Arnabah after midnight, and that three children and two adults died when the town of Saraqeb was bombed.

On Tuesday, air strikes by Russian and Syrian government warplanes reportedly killed at least 28 people, including a family of eight in the village of Kfar Taal.

The European Union condemned the repeated air strikes and shelling of targeting civilians on Thursday, saying they were ""unacceptable and must cease"".

""The EU will keep the sanctions against the Assad regime under review as long as these brutal attacks continue,"" it added. The incidents came as pro-government forces continued their offensive in Idlib.

Almost 350,000 civilians, 80% of them women and children, have been displaced by the fighting since hostilities escalated at the start of December, the United Nations has said.An estimated 400,000 fled their homes between May and August. The International Rescue Committee has warned that 650,000 could be at risk of displacement if the violence continues

A cessation of hostilities agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey, which backs the opposition, went into effect earlier this month, but the violence has continued.

The UN has said the current crisis is compounding an already dire humanitarian situation in north-western Syria, where 32% of the newly displaced are living in camps or individual tents.

The winter weather is adding another layer of urgency to the situation, with flooding frequently affecting camps and informal settlements, and many families seeking shelter in unfinished buildings.

There is also a shortage of medical supplies and functioning medical facilities. At least 50 health facilities have been attacked in Idlib in the past year.


Syrian state media said members of a jihadist alliance had set off car bombs and used heavy fire as they targeted positions in the Maarat al-Numan area.

But they did not mention casualties.

A Syrian military source was cited as saying army units were redeployed to the area and eventually repelled the attacks ""with high efficiency"".

Syria war: Air strikes kill 18 in Idlib city despite truce,"At least 18 civilians are reported to have died in air strikes that hit a market and an industrial zone in the Syrian rebel-held city of Idlib.

A monitoring group said Russian and Syrian government planes carried out the attacks.

The air strikes happened despite a ceasefire brokered earlier this month by Russia and Turkey.

Idlib is the capital of the north-west province of the same name and is the last stronghold of rebel groups.

Neither the Syrian government nor its Russian allies have so far commented on the latest air strikes.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said bombardments had hit the busy al-Hal market and the industrial zone in Idlib city on Wednesday. A correspondent for AFP news agency said several cars in the industrial zone were engulfed in flames with the drivers dead inside them.

A repair shop owner, called Mustafa, told AFP he had just left his store to pick up some spare parts when the strike happened.

He said he returned to find the shop destroyed and his four employees trapped beneath the rubble.

""This is not the neighbourhood I left two minutes ago,"" Mustafa said. SOHR said children and rescue workers were among the casualties.

Pro-opposition Step News Agency said other areas in Idlib province were also targeted.

Israel-Iran: Risk of an all-out conflict grows after Syria strikes,"The Israeli Air Force's strikes against targets in Syria mark the latest stage in a developing struggle between Israel and Iran, one that inevitably risks a much broader conflict.

Iran is eager to bolster its military footprint in Syria. Israel is just as eager to stop it.

But Iran shows no sign of faltering. It is developing its military capabilities and showing a greater self-confidence. The two players are struggling to establish new ""rules"" of deterrence, but the risk is that as the level of their military exchanges increases, so the risk of an all-out conflict grows too.

The cycle of attack and riposte is all too familiar.

Ostensibly the Israeli air attacks were prompted by the firing of four rockets from Syrian territory earlier in the week which were intercepted by Israeli Iron Dome air defences.

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the rocket fire may itself have been an Iranian-ordered response to Israeli attacks against Iran's allies, either in Iraq or in the Gaza Strip. The scale of the Israeli riposte was significant. The targets were associated with Iran's Quds Force, some of which were inside Syrian military facilities.A Syrian headquarters was also attacked along with six Syrian surface-to-air missile batteries, to afford the Israeli jets the necessary freedom of action. A senior Israeli security source noted that this was ""a large-scale retaliation, including Iranian casualties"".

The message from Israel to Tehran is clear. Any attacks out of Syria will be met by a disproportionate response. Now it is upping the military stakes.

But Iran is sending a message of its own too.

Despite a long-running Israeli air campaign designed to constrain the Iranian build-up in Syria, Tehran is determined that this project will continue. It is a close ally of the Assad regime in Damascus and it sees Syrian-territory both as a front line across which to confront Israel and as an important link to its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon.

So far, events are all too familiar. But some of the underlying strategic factors are changing, and this makes the rivalry between Israel and Iran ever more dangerous.The first shift is in Iran's capabilities.

The attacks against Saudi oil installations in September by a mix of drones and cruise missiles are generally attributed to Tehran, although it denies this. The precision of the attacks and the effectiveness with which they were carried out surprised many commentators.

Israel looks set to face a much more dangerous missile threat in the future: a combination of Iranian ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as a wide-ranging effort by Tehran to improve the range and accuracy of the missiles it supplies to its allies like Hezbollah and groups in Gaza.

This so-called ""precision programme"" has been under way for some time. The success of the attacks in Saudi Arabia demonstrated what this might mean in practice.

Iran, for all the constraints imposed upon it by international sanctions, has become a significant military player in the region. This has been brought into focus by the publication this week by the Pentagon of a new Iran Military Power Report.

At one level, there is a good deal of strategic messaging here. The US already puts out regular reports on Russian and Chinese military power - to suggest that Iran is in their category is absurd.

But Tehran has honed its abilities and, according to the report, has focused in on three broad areas of activity: ballistic missiles (its alternative to a sophisticated air force, to deliver destructive power at long range); naval forces to threaten international navigation in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz; and unconventional capabilities, that is the use of partners and allies - a network of groupings ranging across the region, including Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and the Gaza Strip.The second shift is in the wider diplomatic context in the region, notably a perception of US ""retreat"", only confirmed by President Donald Trump's abandonment of America's Kurdish allies in Syria. This has provided an environment in which key local players - Israel, Turkey and Iran - are all intent on safeguarding their own interests in their own way.

Washington's ""retreat"" has been Moscow's opportunity, building on its key effort to ensure the survival of the Assad regime. But beyond this and its desire to play up its role, in contrast to Washington's diminishing influence, defining Russia's strategic direction is not easy. It is clearly a significant diplomatic player in Syria.

It also of course maintains strong diplomatic ties with Israel, and effectively turns a blind eye to Israeli air operations over Syria despite having sophisticated air defences deployed there. But despite a significant effort from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Russian President Vladimir Putin has either been unwilling or unable to bring much leverage to bear upon Tehran.

These two factors - Iran's improving capabilities and self-confidence, and the growing self-reliance of regional players - underpin the growing danger of the current situation. Iran and Israel are locked in a strategic rivalry which at any point could erupt into a war on many fronts.

For some analysts, the direction of travel is clear.

Libya conflict: Haftar forces threaten to target civilian planes,"Rebel forces in Libya have threatened to hit civilian planes flying over the capital Tripoli, declaring the city and its surrounding areas a ""no-fly zone"".

Mitiga, the city's only functioning airport, was closed on Wednesday after rockets were fired towards it.

But the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) said it had now been re-opened.

Mitiga has been hit several times since Gen Khalifa Haftar began an offensive to seize Tripoli from the GNA.

In a statement posted on Facebook on Thursday, the GNA said resuming flights at Mitiga was of the ""utmost importance"".

It called on the UN ""to shoulder its responsibility in this regard and to take serious and effective moves to ensure the safety of civilians and secure civilian aviation which faces a dangerous threat from attacking militias"".

It came as top diplomats from Libya's neighbouring countries met in Algeria to discuss ending the conflict in the oil-rich country.What did Haftar's forces say?
Gen Haftar's spokesman, Ahmad al-Mesmari, said in a statement on Wednesday that ""any military or civilian aircraft, regardless of its affiliation, flying over the capital will be destroyed"".

Mr Mesmari said Turkish soldiers deployed to support the GNA were using Mitiga as a base.

The warning came after Mitiga said it had suspended flights following a rocket attack on Wednesday that the GNA blamed on Haftar's forces.The GNA branded the strikes a ""flagrant threat"" to the safety of air traffic and a ""new violation"" of a ceasefire agreed earlier this month.

Gen Haftar's forces did not immediately respond to the accusations, but did say they had shot down a Turkish drone after it took off from the airport.

Mitiga, a former military airbase, has been the only source of commercial flights in the city since Tripoli International Airport was heavily damaged in fighting in 2014.

The airport was re-opened on 14 January following months of closure prompted by repeated air strikes.

What's the background?
Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising which ousted long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi.

The Libyan National Army (LNA), which is loyal to Gen Haftar, controls most of eastern Libya.His forces launched an offensive against the capital in April 2019 but have been unable to take the city. Earlier this month, however, they did take the strategic city of Sirte.

According to the UN, tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the fighting around Tripoli.

The UN-backed government is supported by Turkey and its ally Qatar, while Gen Haftar is backed by Egypt and the UAE.

An internationally brokered ceasefire began earlier this month but within hours both sides accused each other of breaking it.

Libya conflict: Opposition forces 'seize strategic city Sirte',"Opposition forces in Libya say they have taken control of the coastal city of Sirte, in what would be a key strategic gain.

Sirte has been controlled by forces aligned with Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) since Islamic State (IS) militants were expelled in 2016.

The forces, loyal to Gen Khalifa Haftar, have been waging an offensive targeting the capital Tripoli.

The GNA has not yet commented.

A resident of the northern city of Sirte, located on the Mediterranean coast, told Reuters news agency they could see convoys of troops belonging to Gen Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA).

""They control large parts of the city now. We also hear gunfire,"" the unnamed resident added.The reports came after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that his country's troops had begun moving into Libya to support the GNA in Tripoli.

The UN-backed government is supported by Turkey and its ally Qatar, while Gen Haftar is backed by Egypt and the UAE.

What is happening in Sirte?
The LNA said it had taken control of Sirte following a rapid advance on the city preceded by air strikes.""Sirte has been totally liberated... from terrorist groups,"" Ahmad al-Mesmari, spokesman for Gen Haftar's forces, said on television.

It came after a series of posts on Facebook in which the group said it had taken control of key positions, including the local airport, and was making steady progress ""towards the heart of Sirte to cleanse it from the grip of armed militias"".

The GNA has not responded publicly to the reports of the takeover.

Sirte is located roughly midway between Libyan rival armed forces and authorities based in the east and west of the country. It is also near the resource-rich Oil Crescent region.What's the background?
Libya has been torn by violence since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011 by Nato-backed forces.

The country has two rival administrations, the UN-backed one based in Tripoli, and Gen Haftar's one in the eastern city of Tobruk.

The LNA launched its military offensive against the capital Tripoli last April. The group has intensified its efforts to gain ground in recent weeks as Turkey prepared to ramp up military support for the GNA.Gen Haftar's forces were blamed for an air strike on a military academy on Saturday that killed at least 30 people.

Mexican Police Chief Arrested in Massacre of Mormon Family,"MEXICO CITY — The police chief of a small town near Mexico’s border with the United States has been arrested on suspicion that he was involved in the massacre of nine women and children of a Mormon family last month, the Mexican authorities said Friday.

The federal authorities arrested Fidel Alejandro Villegas, the police chief in the town of Janos in the state of Chihuahua, as part of their investigation into the Nov. 4 attack in a remote region in the neighboring state of Sonora.

Mr. Villegas was arrested this week on suspicion of protecting organized crime in the region and of colluding in the killings, a spokesman for Mexico’s Public Security Ministry said.

He is the fourth person to be arrested on suspicion of participating in the murder of the three women and six children, members of a binational Mormon community that farms land in northern Mexico. The case has reverberated across the border, with President Trump once threatening to designate Mexican organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations. The women and children, dual citizens of Mexico and the United States, were traveling in sports utility vehicles on a remote country road when they were attacked by gunmen believed to belong to an organized crime group. Federal officials have said that they are investigating the possibility that the victims were mistaken for members of a rival group.

The F.B.I. has worked with the Mexican authorities in the investigation.

Julián LeBarón, a cousin of the victims, said that the arrest of the Janos police chief confirms that Mexican law enforcement often collaborates with organized crime. “It’s common knowledge down here that the police work with the criminals,” he said by telephone from Chihuahua. “They have a monopoly on security and they get paid a wage for protection, and later we find out that they participate in the murder of women and children,” he said. “These people take resources to protect us and they are murderers themselves.”

Mexico is about to close its most violent year on record, with 32,600 murders reported through November.

The violence is proving to be the biggest challenge to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has centered his crime-fighting strategy around a new law enforcement agency, the National Guard, and promised that an emphasis on social policies would address the root causes of crime.But the National Guard proved to be of little help on the day the members of the extended LeBarón and Langford families were killed. The authorities did not arrive at the scene until 10 hours later, Mr. LeBarón said.

“I’ve been marching in Mexico and speaking out against the violence,’’ he said. “And I have never seen a case where a victim has had justice.” Mr. LeBarón’s brother was killed 10 years ago when he stood up to local gangs and nobody has been tried for that crime, he said.

The federal authorities arrested Fidel Alejandro Villegas, the police chief in the town of Janos in the state of Chihuahua, as part of their investigation into the Nov. 4 attack in a remote region in the neighboring state of Sonora.

Mr. Villegas was arrested this week on suspicion of protecting organized crime in the region and of colluding in the killings, a spokesman for Mexico’s Public Security Ministry said.

He is the fourth person to be arrested on suspicion of participating in the murder of the three women and six children, members of a binational Mormon community that farms land in northern Mexico. The case has reverberated across the border, with President Trump once threatening to designate Mexican organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations. The women and children, dual citizens of Mexico and the United States, were traveling in sports utility vehicles on a remote country road when they were attacked by gunmen believed to belong to an organized crime group. Federal officials have said that they are investigating the possibility that the victims were mistaken for members of a rival group.

The F.B.I. has worked with the Mexican authorities in the investigation.

Julián LeBarón, a cousin of the victims, said that the arrest of the Janos police chief confirms that Mexican law enforcement often collaborates with organized crime. “It’s common knowledge down here that the police work with the criminals,” he said by telephone from Chihuahua. “They have a monopoly on security and they get paid a wage for protection, and later we find out that they participate in the murder of women and children,” he said. “These people take resources to protect us and they are murderers themselves.”

Mexico is about to close its most violent year on record, with 32,600 murders reported through November.

The violence is proving to be the biggest challenge to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has centered his crime-fighting strategy around a new law enforcement agency, the National Guard, and promised that an emphasis on social policies would address the root causes of crime.But the National Guard proved to be of little help on the day the members of the extended LeBarón and Langford families were killed.

Mexico says 7 now held over slaughter of Mormon U.S. family members,"Mexico City — Prosecutors in Mexico said a total of seven suspects have now been detained in connection with the Nov. 4 slaughter of nine U.S. dual-national women and children.


Federal prosecutors said three men were arrested in recent days and charged with organized crime for drug offenses, though none apparently yet faces homicide charges.

They said four other suspects are being held under a form of house arrest. The name of one suspect announced by federal prosecutors Monday partially matches the police chief of the town of Janos, Chihuahua, near where the killings occurred.Local media reported the police chief had been arrested in the killings of members of the extended LeBaron family. They reported the police chief had been in the pay of the La Linea drug gang.

However, prosecutors in Mexico are barred by law from identifying suspects by their full name, and would not confirm the man's identity.But Julian LeBaron, who lost relatives and friends in the ambush, said the police chief had been arrested, and added ""that should be very worrying to everyone.""

""Who vets them?"" LeBaron asked. ""He (the police chief) was there for 13 years"", he said, questioning how state authorities could not have known the man was working for a drug cartel.

Many members of the extended family have questioned why Mexico's strict gun laws prevent them from having firepower equal to the cartels'.

""The police have a local monopoly on weapons and they participate in the murder of women and children,"" LeBaron said.

Authorities have suggested a drug gang was responsible for the ambush that killed nine American women and children whose families have lived for decades in Chihuahua and neighboring Sonora state.They consider themselves Mormon but are not affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and many have dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship.",unspecified / police,Mexico,,,seven suspects,over slaughter,,,,Mexico City — Prosecutors in Mexico said a total of seven suspects have now been detained in connection with the Nov. 4 slaughter of nine U.S. dual-national women and children.,"Mexico City — Prosecutors in Mexico said a total of seven suspects have now been detained in connection with the Nov. 4 slaughter of nine U.S. dual-national women and children.

Scores of civilians killed in Burkina Faso terrorist attack,"Thirty-six civilians were murdered on Monday in Burkina Faso’s Sanmatenga province when  armed militants reportedly forced their way into the market of the village of Alamou.

Dangote: Kano Speaker bribery allegation embarrassing,"Africas leading industrialist, Aliko Dangote has an advice for the committee set up by the Kano State House of Assembly to probe a bribery allegation against its former speaker: Dont waste your time, its all falsehood. 
 Dangote Group spokesman, Mr. Tony Chiejina said the allegation has no foundation whatsoever and is an outright falsehood. 
 On 17 June, an online portal, DailyNigerian.com,  ostensibly fishing for traffic first published the unsubstantiated allegation that Dangote gave the former Kano Assembly Speaker, Alhaji Kabiru Rurum N100 million to kill  a probe of Emir Muhammadu Sanusi. 
 The portal, with no address or names of its masterminds,  provided no evidence of the bribe. And it came after Governor Abdullahi Ganduje had said the Assembly was prevailed upon by well meaning Nigerians, led by the Acting President Yemi Osinbajo to drop the investigation of the respected Emir over allegations of financial misdeed. 
 Rurum responding to the allegation in an interview on 20 June,  described the story as false, designed to tarnish his image and bring the whole Assembly into disrepute. 
 He gave DailyNigeria.com one week within which to retract the report and apologise to the  State Assembly or face legal action. 
 According to him, the report is also targeted at creating tension and chaos among the lawmakers and ridicule the personality of Dangote. 
 `The story was just a fabrication, a tissue of lies and unjustifiable, because there was never a time I met with Dangote to discuss such issue, not to talk of him offering bribe to us. 
 He said  that the intervention of Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Northern Governors and other notable Nigerians to stop the probe was channeled through the state governor and not the assembly. 
 It is a tradition that when such things happened, the Governor gets in touch with us as one of the three arms of government. 
 Therefore, the governor forwarded his request letter appealing for the suspension of the investigation on behalf of all the concerned citizens. 
 But it appeared fellow legislators believed the unsubstantiated story by DailyNigerian.com, such that two weeks after, they went for Rurums head,  forcing him to resign on Monday 3 July. 
 Chiejina told NAN on Monday night that the allegation has been embarrassing, to Dangote. 
 Aliko Dangote does not even know the embattled speaker, Hon. Kabiru Alhassan Rurum, let alone being his friend as alleged by the report, Chiejina said. 
 The Kano Assembly meanwhile has asked a five-man committee to investigate the allegations against Rurum. 
 The new Speaker, Alhaji Abdullahi Atta, proposed the investigation at the plenary. It was unanimously accepted by the house. 
 Atta gave the committee, which has as the chairman, the Deputy Chief Whip of the Assembly, Alhaji Muhammad Butu-Butu, a member representing Rimin Gado/Tofa Constituency,  three months to submit its report. 
 The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the former speaker had in his resignation letter said he resigned in order to protect his image and that of his constituency over the corruption allegations.

Erdogan shuts down Twitter,"Access to micro-blogging site Twitter is now blocked in Turkey. This comes after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's push for a ban of social media network. 
 ""We will wipe out Twitter. I don't care what the international community says,"" he told followers at a rally in the run-up to March 30 local elections. Everyone could expect to see Turkey's strength, he added while drumming up support in the northwestern city of Bursa on Thursday (20.03.2014). 
 According to Turkish newspaper ""Hürriyet,"" Erdogan's press department issued a statement shortly afterward to explain the prime minster's decree. Twitter had ""ignored"" Turkish court orders to remove certain links after Turkish citizens had filed complaints. On Friday (21.03.2014), Turkish newspaper ""Radikal"" published a statement by the public prosecutor's office which said that there was no court order to block Twitter. 
 Shortly after the ban was imposed, Turkish President Abdullah Gul made headlines by strongly criticizing the decision to block the platform. ""One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,"" Gul tweeted, clearly circumventing the ban. ""I hope this implementation won't last long."" 
 Gul, a frequent user of social media, has been critical of Erdogan's censorship moves long before - he chafed at the beginning of March when Erdogan demanded YouTube and Facebook be blocked. ""YouTube and Facebook are recognized platforms all over the world. A ban is out of the question,"" Gul said at the time. 
 Criticism continues online, despite the ban 
 According to market researchers GlobalWebIndex, around 40 percent of Turkish Internet users are registered on Twitter. After the ban was imposed, shortly after midnight, people turned to other social media platforms such as Facebook to vent about the Erdogan administration. 
 Turkey's president has criticized Erdogan's move and says Twitter should not be blocked 
 ""It's such a shame to have Erdogan as prime minister. I fear he is going to shut down the entire country,"" a Facebook user wrote. ""My beloved democratic country! After the elections you are going to block Facebook as well. These messages are the last bits of our freedom,"" another posted. People also drew comparisons to other countries where Twitter is blocked. ""What countries are blocking Twitter? Yes indeed, Turkey is now on the same level as China,"" a Facebook user wrote. 
 Shortly after the ban was imposed, people began sharing tips via cell phone apps and videos on how to circumvent the ban by changing one's DNS settings to allow access to Twitter. ""It took me two minutes to change the DNS settings; I can now use Twitter again,"" a Facebook user wrote. This trick was picked up by millions of other Twitter users. Just a few hours after Twitter was blocked, hashtags like #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #TurkeyBlockedTwitter were top of the global hashtag ranks. 
 Despite the ban, members of the Turkish government have continued to tweet as well - like Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc who announced that Erdogan's Justice and Development Party's (AKP) election campaign would be in the province of Manisa on Friday. ""Arinc uses Twitter for his daily election campaign? Now I'm confused. Why then block the site at all?"" a user complained. 
 Social media pressures Erdogan 
 Erdogan's fight against Twitter started last year when protests in Istanbul's Gezi Park were in full swing. He publicly called the platform a ""menace,"" stressing again and again that Twitter was distributing lies. In the past year, Twitter has been used as the main means of communication for millions of demonstrators in Turkey. Mass protests were widely organized via the service. 
 People in Turkey have to resort to tricks to be able to access Twitter 
 But Erdogan and his government have increasingly come under pressure - more so after a corruption scandal involving the Erdogan administration was unveiled in mid-December. Since then, alleged telephone conversations between Erdogan and his son Bilal were leaked and published on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. In these conversations, Erdogan reportedly told his son to hide huge sums of money. It's still unclear to this date who is responsible for publishing these recordings. Erdogan has accused a parallel state led by US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, a former political ally of Erdogan. 
 Media expert Asli Tunc of Istanbul's Bilgi University told DW that shutting down Twitter doesn't make sense. ""It's very hard to fight such technology. There will be software and programs that help people circumvent the ban,"" she said. The Turkish government blocked YouTube a couple of years ago, but even back then there had been many possibilities to circumvent the ban. 
 Amnesty International has also strongly criticized the ban and called on the Turkish government to immediately reinstate access to Twitter.

Mali rebels threaten France over intervention,"Al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Mali have threatened to ""open the doors of hell"" for French citizens if France kept pushing for armed intervention to retake the rebel-held north. The renewed threats against French hostages and expatriates came on Saturday as French-speaking nations met in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where French President Francois Hollande was expected to urge the rapid deployment of an African-led force to rout the rebels. 
 Hollande said the threat would not deter France's determination to quash the rebels in Mali. 
 ""If he continues to throw oil on the fire, we will send him the pictures of dead French hostages in the coming days,"" said Oumar Ould Hamaha, a spokesman for the armed group MUJWA, in apparent reference to the six French nationals still held by armed groups after being seized in the region. 
 ""He will not be able to count the bodies of French expatriates across West Africa and elsewhere,"" Hamaha said by telephone. 
 Military intervention 
 MUJWA is among the groups which seized control of the northern two-thirds of Mali when fighters swept into the territory in April following a coup in the capital Bamako. 
 Regional and Western powers are now considering armed intervention to retake the area, with former colonial ruler France seeking swift military action by regional bloc ECOWAS. 
 The UN Security Council called on Friday for an intervention plan to be drawn up within 45 days after passing a French-drafted resolution to revive attempts to end the crisis. 
 Hollande on Saturday dismissed the MUJWA threat, saying it would not alter its stance on Mali. 
 ""We have always said that we would always do everything to secure the release of our hostages,"" he told a news conference in Kinshasa. 
 ""Should we tone down our message on the integrity of Mali, on the fight against terrorism, because of these threats? I think it's quite the opposite."" 
 ""It's by showing our determination to stand by our position of fighting terrorism that we can convince the abductors that it is time to free our hostages,"" he added. 
 Al-Qaeda's north African wing has threatened repeatedly to kill French hostages if Paris tries to mount a military intervention in Mali. 
 Seven workers for French firm Areva were seized in northern Niger in 2010, and all but four have since been released. Two other French citizens were taken hostage in Mali in November. 
 MUJWA's Hamaha said that the armed groups in the Sahara desert were largely funded by ransom payments from France and others. 
 ""The top country who finances the jihadis is France,"" he said, adding that MUJWA could try to kidnap Hollande himself. 
 ""I wonder what the international community would say if we took the French president hostage.""",Al-Qaeda-linked fighters,rebels,,,France,over intervention,,,,"Al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Mali have threatened to ""open the doors of hell"" for French citizens if France kept pushing for armed intervention to retake the rebel-held north.","Al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Mali have threatened to ""open the doors of hell"" for French citizens if France kept pushing for armed intervention to retake the rebel-held north.

 ""Should we tone down our message on the integrity of Mali, on the fight against terrorism, because of these threats? I think it's quite the opposite."" 
 ""It's by showing our determination to stand by our position of fighting terrorism that we can convince the abductors that it is time to free our hostages,"" he added. 
 Al-Qaeda's north African wing has threatened repeatedly to kill French hostages if Paris tries to mount a military intervention in Mali. 
 Seven workers for French firm Areva were seized in northern Niger in 2010, and all but four have since been released. Two other French citizens were taken hostage in Mali in November. 
 MUJWA's Hamaha said that the armed groups in the Sahara desert were largely funded by ransom payments from France and others. 
 ""The top country who finances the jihadis is France,"" he said, adding that MUJWA could try to kidnap Hollande himself. 
 ""I wonder what the international community would say if we took the French president hostage.""",Al-Qaeda-linked fighters,Qaeda,,,France,linked fighters in Mali,,

Police seal Anambra PDP secretariat,"The Anambra Police Command on Wednesday sealed the State Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) located at Udoka Estate in Awka. 
 Mr Haruna Mohammed, the command Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), said the sealing of the secretariat was due to fracas that erupted earlier in the day. 
 He noted that the closure of the office would avert further breakdown of law and order. 
 Mohammed added that the state had been peaceful over time and the police would not allow anybody to jeopardise the relative peaceful situation prevalent in the state under whatever cover. 
 The police would take control of the area until when normalcy returns, he said. 
 The PPRO denied the allegation that some of the protesters and their supporters were brutalised by thugs and some policemen. 
 Mr Ndubuisi Durkins, Assistant Legal Adviser of the party, who led the protest, had claimed that some of their members were injured. 
 He said the cause of their action was the imposition of a caretaker leadership on them by the national hierarchy of the party, in spite of a substantive court judgment that annulled the arrangement. 
 The protesters alleged that the chairman of the caretaker committee, Ndubuisi Nwobu, was a sellout who abandoned their collective struggle for what they called selfish and pecuniary interests. 
 Before the police took over the premises, it was gathered that the caretaker committee members had allegedly broken the secretariat gate to gain entrance for a meeting. 
 Addressing reporters, Mr Ndubuisi Nwobu, the caretaker chairman described the protest as a plan by the opposition to sabotage PDP chances in the 2019 general elections in Anambra.

Nigeria accused of targeting newspapers,"At least four Nigerian newspapers said soldiers have stopped and seized copies of its editions over security concerns, with one paper likening the raids to censorship during the country's military rule. 
 The military confirmed the searches, the AFP news agency reported, but officers denied that the moves were designed to muzzle critics, even though at least two of the newspapers had published articles denouncing the army in recent days. 
 Four dailies - The Nation, the Daily Trust, the Leadership and Punch - all said they were affected, while The Nation said soldiers stormed one of its circulation offices. 
 The Daily Trust said the military set up roadblocks around its offices in the capital Abuja and the northern city of Kano, as they confiscated its newspaper editions and arrested delivery truck drivers. 
 ""One of the military men told us that they were acting on order from above as there were allegations that newspaper circulation vehicles were being used to smuggle arms and ammunition,"" one of The Nation's distribution managers said. 
 The early morning raids did not appear to target specific editions and the copies seized were destined for all parts of the country, the newspapers said online. 
 Defence spokesman Chris Olukolade said the search ""followed intelligence report[s] indicating movement of materials with grave security implications across the country using the channel of newsprint-related consignments"". 
 Nigeria's military has been under sustained pressure, including in the media, over its response to attacks by the armed group Boko Haram, which abducted more than 200 schoolgirls in April. 
 'Routine security action' 
 Attacks by the group, which have claimed thousands of lives since it began five years ago, have increased, with the military apparently powerless to prevent the violence. 
 But Olukolade rejected reports the army was trying to stifle free speech, calling the media ""an indispensable partner in the ongoing counter-insurgency operation and the overall advancement of our country's democratic credentials"". 
 ""As such, the military will not deliberately and without cause, infringe on the freedom of the press,"" he added, calling the search a ""routine security action"". 
 Sue Valentine, Africa programme coordinator for the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) warned that ""denying Nigerians access to news and information sows the seeds of rumours and distrust"".

Nigerians fail to reach deal to avert strikes,"Nigeria's government and labour unions have failed to come to an agreement over high fuel costs, two weeks after the state withdrew subsidies, prompting protests nationwide. 
 Although Saturday's talks ended without a deal, the dialogue between union representatives and the government was continuing, sources said. 
 ""We have not reached a compromise"", Abdulwaheed Omar, the president of Nigeria's Labour Congress, announced outside the presidential palace late on Saturday night. 
 Asked if they would now begin shutting down oil platforms, as the unions had earlier promised if the Saturday meeting failed, he said: ""No, we are taking this thing gradually. We are still giving peace a chance."" 
 Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa, reporting from Abuja, the Nigerian capital, said: ""They say that all the unions will meet again on Sunday with government representatives. 
 ""They seem keen to end the strike. They don't want to go back on the streets on Monday, say some union leaders."" 
 Talks ongoing 
 The oil union, PENGASSAN, said the union expected further talks on Sunday morning that they would be monitoring before deciding on further action. 
 ""In the interest of the ongoing negotiations, the PENGASSAN session has alerted all our members at all production platforms to execute the systematic shutdown if the negotiation process breaks down,"" Babatunde Oke, the PENGASSAN spokesman said, said. 
 Nigeria, which produces about 2.4m barrels of crude a day, is the fifth-largest oil exporter to the US. While the country has a several-week stock of oil ready for export, the threatened shutdown on Sunday could shake oil futures as traders remained concerns about worldwide supply. 
 The strike began on Monday, paralysing the nation of more than 160 million people. 
 David Mark, the senate president, who has been acting as a mediator in the process, said after Saturday's talks that the two sides were on the ""right path"", but he provided no details on how a compromise could be reached. 
 Owei Lakemfa, the Nigeria Labour Congress secretary general, said after the meeting that the government was insisting on negotiating on a price while unions are demanding a return to 65 naira. 
 Lakemfa said the meeting ""did not go well for Nigeria because we did not reach an agreement ... because the country is bleeding"".

 President Goodluck Jonathan's government abandoned annual subsidies totalling $8bn that kept fuel prices low on January 1, causing prices to jump from $1.70 per gallon to at least $3.50 per gallon. 
 The costs of food and transportation also largely doubled in a nation where most people live on less than $2 each day. 
 Anger over losing one of the few benefits average Nigerians see from being an oil-rich country, as well as disgust over government corruption, have led to demonstrations across the nation and violence that has killed at least 10 people. 
 Red Cross volunteers have treated more than 600 people injured in protests since the strike began, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday.

Kenya firebrand cleric's death sparks protest,"Kenyan police and Muslim youths have clashed in Mombasa following Friday prayers, witnesses said, days after a firebrand Muslim cleric was gunned down in the port city. 
 Security was tight and tensions high around the Musa mosque, seen by Kenyan authorities as a terrorist propaganda hub and recruiting ground for people planning terror attacks. 
 A prominent cleric closely associated with the mosque, Abubaker Shariff Ahmed better known as Makaburi, was shot dead in Mombasa on Tuesday. 
 Makaburi was a vocal supporter of al-Qaeda and Somalia's al-Shabab rebel group and prior to his death had accused Kenyan security forces of seeking to kill him. 
 After Friday's prayers, worshippers and police fought brief running battles including stone-throwing and the use of tear gas.""When our sheikhs are being killed they [the police] are just there, they are just looking, but they are not doing anything. We as a Muslim society just want peace,"" one worshipper told AFP.'Leading facilitator' 
 Makaburi was on a UN sanctions lists, accused of being a ""leading facilitator and recruiter of young Kenyan Muslims for violent militant activity in Somalia"", and of having ""strong ties"" with al-Shabab leaders. 
 The cleric, who was in his 50s, had also openly praised the al-Shabab fighters who stormed Nairobi's Westgate mall in September last year, killing at least 67 people in a four-day siege that was carried out in retaliation for the presence of Kenyan troops in Somalia. 
 In August 2012, outspoken preacher Aboud Rogo Mohammed was also gunned down, and in October last year his successor, Sheikh Ibrahim Ismail, met the same fate on a road near Mombasa, again sparking riots. 
 On Friday, Human Rights Watch said Kenya must carry out a thorough investigation into Makaburi's killing or else risk an escalation of religious violence.

Kenya faces second day of protests,"  The protesters vowed to avenge the killings of two demonstrators in clashes with police in Kisumu the previous day, the first of three days of mass opposition rallies to protest Kibaki's re-election in December 27 polls. 
  
 Raila Odinga, the opposition leader, who says he was robbed of the presidency, has accused security forces of using excessive brutality against protesters. 
 Alfred Mutua, a government spokesman, blamed the violence on gangs of organised rioters keen to loot and harass the public. 
 
Momentum intact

 

In Nairobi on Wednesday, opposition supporters tried to reach the central Uhuru (Freedom) Park - which was ringed by officers in riot gear.

 ""We are not losing momentum,"" William Ruto, a senior Odinga ally, said after his convoy was teargassed as it tried to reach the park.
 
In Kisumu, security forces shot dead three men.

""They have not learnt their lesson since killing at least 44 people last week. They must be held accountable.""
 
In footage shown by local broadcaster KTN, one Kisumu policeman was seen firing his assault rifle at a young man in a black T-shirt who was pulling faces at other officers.
 
The man in the black T-shirt fell down, then the policeman ran over and kicked him. KTN, which said four people were feared killed in Wednesday's trouble, said the youth later died.
 
Across Kenya, more than 600 have been killed in riots and a wave of tribal violence since the outcome of the ballot, which international observers said fell short of democratic standards.
 
A quarter of a million, many of them members of Kibaki's Kikuyu ethnic group, have been forced from their homes.
 
Descent into chaos
 
Kenya's descent into crisis has tarnished its democratic credentials, dismayed world powers, scared off tourists and hurt one of Africa's most promising economies.
 
The US and former colonial power Britain have called on Kibaki's government to let peaceful protests go ahead.
 
They and 11 other nations have threatened to cut aid if the government's commitment to ""good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights weakens"".
 
Since being sworn in on December 30, Kibaki, 76, has entrenched his position by naming most of a new cabinet and calling parliament to meet.
 
The ODM has 99 seats in the newly elected parliament, making it the largest single party but short of an overall majority.
 
Kibaki's Party of National Unity won 43 seats and an ally secured 16.
 
First defeat
 
The opposition on Tuesday narrowly got its choice for speaker, Kenneth Marende, elected, dealing the government its first defeat.
 

Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general, was expected to help mediate in the political crisis, but he delayed his trip as he was recovering from a bout of flu.
 Speaking from Nairobi, Andrew Simmons, Al Jazeera's Africa correspondent, said: ""The ODM intends to keep up the pressure with demonstrations over the next few days. The government is stressing the term dialogue, not mediation.
 
""Annan is still sick but he is due here in the next few days. And he needs to address this question: What does dialogue mean?""

They and 11 other nations have threatened to cut aid if the government's commitment to ""good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights weakens"".
 
Since being sworn in on December 30, Kibaki, 76, has entrenched his position by naming most of a new cabinet and calling parliament to meet.
 
The ODM has 99 seats in the newly elected parliament, making it the largest single party but short of an overall majority.
 
Kibaki's Party of National Unity won 43 seats and an ally secured 16.
 
First defeat
 
The opposition on Tuesday narrowly got its choice for speaker, Kenneth Marende, elected, dealing the government its first defeat.
 

Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general, was expected to help mediate in the political crisis, but he delayed his trip as he was recovering from a bout of flu.
 Speaking from Nairobi, Andrew Simmons, Al Jazeera's Africa correspondent, said: ""The ODM intends to keep up the pressure with demonstrations over the next few days. The government is stressing the term dialogue, not mediation.
 
""Annan is still sick but he is due here in the next few days. And he needs to address this question: What does dialogue mean?"" 
  
 Alfred Mutua, a government spokesman, blamed the violence on gangs of organised rioters keen to loot and harass the public. 
  
 Momentum intact 
 In Nairobi on Wednesday, opposition supporters tried to reach the central Uhuru (Freedom) Park - which was ringed by officers in riot gear.

Opinion: Indonesia executions are a mockery of justice,"More than 2,000 Congolose refugees in the Russian-run camp of Kiziba in western Rwanda have held demonstrations against cuts to food rations over the past week. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) decreased rations by 25 percent after several European donor countries withdrew their support. 
 Frustrations came to a head last Thursday when Rwandan police shot dead 11 refugees during a protest inside Kiziba, according to a revised figure issued by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) while another 20 were wounded — including seven police officers. 
 ""We have detained five of the instigators of these illegal protests,"" police spokesperson, Theos Badege told DW. Seven police officers also suffered injuries during the protests. 
 The camp is one of six Rwandan refugee camps which hosts refugees who fled the political unrest in Burundi and ethnic violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The camp in Kiziba currently hosts 17,000 people.

 UNHCR calls for an investigation 
 The police defended their harsh crackdown, saying that the protesters were not cooperating. The refugees had allegedly been advised not to leave the camp and remain calm as long as the government was still negotiating with the UNHCR. The protesters had, however, not complied with this order and marched towards the capital, Kigali. Some of the protesters had armed themselves with sticks and stones, according to police. 
 The government must guarantee the security of the refugees, a UNHCR spokesperson said on Friday, demanding an investigation into the deaths. The organization said that only two percent of its funding appeal for 2018 for Rwanda had been secured.

 July 21, 2015: After three months of protests against Pierre Nkurunziza's third term and fierce battles between Nkurunziza’s supporters and the opposition, the presidential election was finally held. But the opposition chose to boycott it. 
 July 24, 2015: President Nkurunziza wins the presidential election in the first round. With 69% of the vote, he was far ahead of his main challenger, Agathon Rwasa. By the end of July, Rwasa was surprisingly elected as first vice president of the national assembly, sparking criticism from his former allies. 
 August 1, 2015: Adolphe Nshimirimana, head of internal security and considered the right-hand man of the president, is assassinated. In a statement, the European Union raised concern over this ""dangerous escalation of violence."" Brussels calls for ""restraint"" and a resumption of ""dialogue."" 
 August 3, 2015: Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa, head of the human rights organization (APRODH), survives an assassination attempt and is evacuated to Brussels for medical treatment. But his family continues to be targeted and in October 2015 one of his sons-in-laws is killed and a month later his son is also murdered in Bujumbura. 
 Since the crisis began, a large number of Burundian refugees fled to neighboring Rwanda. On November 6, 2015, President Kagame spoke about what was happening in Burundi: ""People are dying every day, corpses littering the streets,"" he said. ""They should learn from what happened here."" Nkurunziza’s team fired back, accusing Rwanda of training rebels seeking to destabilize the country. 
 December 12, 2015: A crackdown begins on neighborhoods like Nyakabiga that were believed to be strongholds of protesters. This came after an attack by rebels against three military camps. More than a hundred victims were identified. The UN said that 400 people had been killed since April 26 and 3,500 were arrested in connection with the crisis. 
 December 17, 2015: The United Nations warns that the situation in Burundi is ""highly explosive"" and that the country is on the path to a civil war. Adama Dieng, the UN special rapporteur on the prevention of genocide, warns of a possible genocide. ""If a conflict breaks out on a large scale, we cannot pretend that we did not know about it,"" he said. 
 December 23, 2015: A former army officer in the Burundian army forms the ""Republican Forces of Burundi"" (FOREBU). Lieutenant Colonel Edouard Nshimirimana accuses Pierre Nkurunziza of instigating the security forces to commit acts of violence and pitting police and military against each other along ethnic lines. 
 December 28, 2015: Inter-Burundian peace talks start in Entebbe under the auscipices of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The African Union (AU) also announces that it will deploy a 5,000-strong peacekeeping force to help secure the country, an idea that is immediately rejected by the Burundian government. 
 January 2016: Mediation fails to kickoff in Arusha. A month later, February 25 -26, the African Union sends a ""high- level"" delegation to Bujumbura led by South African President Jacob Zuma. It’s another failed attempt. Bujumbura refuses to talk with the opposition CNARED. UNHCR announces a group of independent experts to investigate violations of human rights in Burundi. 
 April 18, 2016: The UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein criticizes Burundi’s security forces for routinely torturing prisoners. Since the beginning of the year, his team had registered at least 345 new cases of torture. He urged the Burundian authorities to immediately put an end to torture in all its forms. 
 May 21, 2016: After another delay, the Inter-Burundian dialogue resumes in Arusha, Tanzania at the initiative of the Tanzanian mediator, former President Benjamin Mkapa. The Burundian authorities demand that the opposition coalition CNARED should not be part of the dialogue. In June, the facilitator [Mkapa] travels to Brussels to meet members of the Opposition for the first time. 
 June 3: Eleven students from a high school in Muramvya, in central Burundi, were charged and jailed for insulting the head of state. Their crime: doodled pictures of President Nkurunziza. A week earlier, more than 300 college students from Ruziba, south of Bujumbura, were expelled from school for the same reason. 
 July 13, 2016. Hafsa Mossi, a former minister believed to be close to President Nkurunziza, is murdered near his home. A member of the ruling CNDD-FDD party, the former journalist was also the communications advisor for Nkurunziza. It is the first time a prominent political figure has been assassinated in Burundi. 
 The crisis in Burundi was on the agenda of the 27th AU Summit in Kigali in July, but it took place without a representative from Bujumbura. The Burundi delegation left the Rwandan capital without explanation just days before the start of the summit. No action was taken against the government of President Pierre Nkurunziza, who still refuses to negotiate with the opposition.

 Too hungry to study 
 Around 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of Kiziba, in neighboring Tanzania, lies the Nyarugusu refugee camp. About 200,000 people from Burundi and DRC live here. They too are feeling the shortage in food aid. 
 ""The refugees go to our fields and steal our cassava and potatoes,"" says Amandusi Ndondeye, a representative from the local government. 
 Young women from the camps have turned to prostitution to make ends meet. ""We have very little money,"" says Marco Lujulika, a resident from the camp. ""We need to be able to provide for ourselves and we at least need enough food to eat. The children are crying all the time and the ones who go to school can't concentrate on an empty stomach,"" he says. 
 Faustin Lumona is the camp's education coordinator. ""The children often come to school late, or they skip school altogether. Some fall asleep in class and all this because of the hunger,"" he told DW. ""They also don't manage to study at home. Instead they go to the fields to try and find some food."" 
 Unable to work 
 Refugees in Nyarugusu camp need a special permit to leave the camp 
 Without any additional sources of income, the hardships in the camps are barely manageable. In order to actually leave the camp and earn money, the refugees need a special permit. ""The people try to earn a bit of money on the farms in the area,"" explains Angelique Abiola, a spokesperson for the refugees in the camp. ""But if you are caught without a permit, then you're in trouble,” she says. 
 Over the years, Tanzania has often hosted refugees from the neighboring countries. The plight of the refugees at the Burundian border has, however, pushed Tanzania to its limits. The Tanzanian government is said to have encouraged the ‘voluntary' return of the refugees and some have indeed gone home despite the dangers.

UPDATE 4-Nigerian union orders oil shutdown from Sunday,"Nigeria’s main oil union said on Thursday it would shut down output from Africa’s biggest oil producer on Sunday if the government did not reverse its decision to remove popular fuel subsidies. 
 Tens of thousands of Nigerians have been protesting up and down Africa’s most populous nation for four straight days in response to the axing of the petrol subsidy, which more than doubled the price to around 150 naira ($0.93) per litre. 
 “PENGASSAN shall be forced to go ahead and apply the bitter option of ordering the systematic shutting down of oil and gas production with effect from ... 0000 hours of Sunday Jan. 15 (2300 GMT on Saturday Jan. 14), if the federal government of Nigeria fails to yield to the popular agitation of Nigerians on her unacceptable approach to fuel subsidy removal,” the oil union said in a statement. 
 President Goodluck Jonathan entered a meeting with labour unions in the presidential villa on Thursday, in an effort to reach an agreement to end the strike. 
 Industry officials doubted unions would be able to stop crude exports completely because much of production is automated and Nigeria has crude stored in reserves, but even a minor outage could have a significant impact on the economy. 
 Worries over Nigerian oil supplies have pushed up global oil prices. 
 Nigeria produces more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per day and is a key supplier to United States, Europe and Asia. Crude exports provide Africa’s second-largest economy with over 90 percent of foreign exchange revenues. 
 “If there is any disruption to oil production it would be a serious escalation and the government would be likely to use legal or enforcement means to stop it,” said Kayode Akindele, partner at Lagos-based investment firm 46 Parallels. 
 Container shipping group Maersk Line said it was unable to bring its vessels carrying consumer goods and foodstuffs into Nigeria’s ports as a fourth day of nationwide strikes brought terminals to a standstill. 
 Protests were ongoing in cities everywhere from the commercial centre Lagos in the south to the remote and restive city of Maiduguri in the far northeast. 
 In Lagos, tens of thousands gathered in Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, where women selling drinks and Afrobeat music pumping out of loud speakers gave the protest a carnival atmosphere. Many chanted anti-government slogans. 
 A group of demonstrators beat drums and slapped an effigy of Jonathan across the face with leafy branches. 
 “Our leaders have betrayed us too many times and this is the last time. They only care about themselves, not the common people,” said Olu Shittu, 30, a student, expressing a widely held view that Nigeria’s elite are too busy lining their own pockets to be moved by the plight of the poor. 
 “We’re staying here until they put the subsidy back.” 
 President Jonathan has shown no sign of backing down on his government’s decision to scrap a subsidy economists say was wasteful and corrupt, but that could change in the current meeting, as pressure mounts on him to yield to public opinion. 
 “I am positive something concrete will come from discussions ... they will not be held in vain,” Reuben Abati, presidential spokesman, told Reuters at the presidential villa in Abuja earlier in the day. 
 Publicly unions have said they will only stop strikes if the government returns petrol prices to the pre-subsidy removal rate of 65 naira and the government has said it will not reverse its decision to scrap subsisides from Jan. 1. 
 The national assembly has already urged the government and unions to back down but without success. 
 Banks, shops, airports and schools remained closed but small market sellers and roadside hawkers carried on trading. 
 In the remote northeastern city of Maiduguri, which is also plagued by an Islamist insurgency and where the government on Thursday imposed a curfew from 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) to 6 a.m. 
 The strikes are costing Africa’s second largest economy around 100 billion naira ($617 million) a day, Central Bank governor Lamido Sanusi told Reuters on Thursday. 
 He expected inflation to rise to around 14-15 percent by the middle of this year, up from 10.5 percent now as the impact of subsidy removal is felt on prices. 
 Nigeria’s main union has remained defiant, insisting it would continue its strike until subsidies are reinstated. 
 “We won’t surrender until the pump price of petrol is reverted to 65 naira,” Owei Lakemfa, general secretary of the National Labour Congress, told Reuters by phone in Abuja. 
 Economists say the subsidy fuelled corruption and keeping it in place would have forced Nigeria into huge external borrowing, but Nigerians, many of whom live on less than $2 a day, saw it as their most tangible welfare benefit. 
 Despite holding the world’s seventh-largest gas reserves and producing over 2 million bpd of crude, decades of graft and mismanagement mean Nigeria does not refine its own fuel. 
 Jonathan is now facing two major security headaches - opposition to the fuel price spike and almost daily attacks by an Islamist group in the north. 
 The leader of Boko Haram, which wants Islamic sharia law more widely applied across Nigeria, appeared in an online video on Tuesday saying Jonathan did not have the capability to stop the group’s insurgency.

Kenya opposition vows to hold rally,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s opposition vowed to pour thousands of demonstrators on to the streets on Thursday after both sides traded accusations of genocide in post-election turmoil that has killed more than 300. 
 Opposition supporters run armed with sticks during ethnic violence in Nairobi January 2, 2008. President Mwai Kibaki's government accused rival Raila Odinga's party of unleashing ""genocide"" in Kenya on Wednesday as the death toll from tribal violence over a disputed election passed 300. REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya 
 The wave of riots and ethnic violence triggered by President Mwai Kibaki’s disputed re-election on Sunday has cut supplies of fuel and other goods to a swathe of central African countries and shocked world powers who called for reconciliation. 
 Kenya is east Africa’s biggest economy and a key ally of the West in its counter-terrorism efforts. It is used to being the peacemaker, rather than the problem, on a volatile continent. 
 As both sides toughened their stance and rhetoric, the opposition said it would push ahead with a banned mass protest on Thursday in the centre of the capital Nairobi. 
 “There is no such law in Kenya that anybody cannot attend a political rally,” William Ruto, a senior official in opposition leader Raila Odinga’s party, told reporters. 
 “We have notified the police commissioner and he should live up to his duty of providing security when that meeting goes on.” 
 The police said the assembly was banned because they did not have the capacity to ensure security. 
 A local and an international rights group said “more than 300” people have died and accused Kenyan security forces of having “bloodily repressed” protests by opposition supporters. 
 Kibaki’s Kikuyu tribe was targeted in the initial clashes but revenge killings by Kikuyus are on the rise. 
 The government said it was becoming clear that “well-organized acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing were well planned, financed and rehearsed” by leaders from Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) ahead of the election. 
 The opposition accused the government of acts “bordering on genocide” by ordering police to shoot protesters enraged by Kibaki’s victory at the polls. International observers said the December 27 election fell short of democratic standards. 
 International efforts to mediate have been stepped up. 
 Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu was due to meet the head of Kenya’s electoral commission on Thursday. Ghanaian President John Kufuor was waiting to talk to Kibaki before deciding whether to visit Nairobi himself or send a team. 
 British Foreign Minister David Miliband and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for an end to violence and “an intensive political and legal process” to end the crisis. 
 The Kenyan government and religious figures urged local leaders to preach unity to ethnically polarized communities.

 The wave of riots and ethnic violence triggered by President Mwai Kibaki’s disputed re-election on Sunday has cut supplies of fuel and other goods to a swathe of central African countries and shocked world powers who called for reconciliation. 
 Kenya is east Africa’s biggest economy and a key ally of the West in its counter-terrorism efforts. It is used to being the peacemaker, rather than the problem, on a volatile continent. 
 As both sides toughened their stance and rhetoric, the opposition said it would push ahead with a banned mass protest on Thursday in the centre of the capital Nairobi. 
 “There is no such law in Kenya that anybody cannot attend a political rally,” William Ruto, a senior official in opposition leader Raila Odinga’s party, told reporters. 
 “We have notified the police commissioner and he should live up to his duty of providing security when that meeting goes on.” 
 The police said the assembly was banned because they did not have the capacity to ensure security. 
 A local and an international rights group said “more than 300” people have died and accused Kenyan security forces of having “bloodily repressed” protests by opposition supporters. 
 Kibaki’s Kikuyu tribe was targeted in the initial clashes but revenge killings by Kikuyus are on the rise. 
 The government said it was becoming clear that “well-organized acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing were well planned, financed and rehearsed” by leaders from Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) ahead of the election. 
 The opposition accused the government of acts “bordering on genocide” by ordering police to shoot protesters enraged by Kibaki’s victory at the polls. International observers said the December 27 election fell short of democratic standards. 
 International efforts to mediate have been stepped up. 
 Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu was due to meet the head of Kenya’s electoral commission on Thursday. Ghanaian President John Kufuor was waiting to talk to Kibaki before deciding whether to visit Nairobi himself or send a team. 
 British Foreign Minister David Miliband and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for an end to violence and “an intensive political and legal process” to end the crisis. 
 The Kenyan government and religious figures urged local leaders to preach unity to ethnically polarized communities.

Airport workers’ strike bites harder,"The strike at the Murtala Muhammed Airport 2 (MMA2), Lagos, enters its second day and the bite has forced airline operators to make alternative arrangements to fly passengers. 
 Aviation unions continued their picketing of the terminal on Thursday. 
 The airlines have moved their passenger boarding and processing to the General Aviation Terminal (GAT) operated by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). 
 The striking unions are the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) and Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria(ATSSSAN) and the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE). 
 They are protesting over the alleged sack of 24 employees who indicated interest to unionise by Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited (BASL), operators of the MMA2. 
 Despite a subsisting court order issued by Justice I. N Buba of a Federal High Court in Lagos restraining them from the action, the unions continued to shutdown flights and business activities at the MMA2. 
 Airlines affected by the action included Arik Air, Medview Airline, Azman Air, Max Air, Dana Air and Aero Contractors who operate flights from the terminal. 
 However, Mr Kingsley Ezenwa, Corporate Communications Manager, Dana Air, said on Thursday that the arrangement to move the airlines passengers to GAT was reached on Wednesday after they were prevented from entering MMA2. 
 We have made an alternative arrangement since yesterday and at the moment, the strike is still ongoing but we are hoping that everything will be resolved as soon as possible. 
 First, we are apologising to our guests for any inconveniences caused by this development. 
  It is so unfortunate that those who actually have no business with what is happening are the ones suffering in the battle between these two organisations. 
 So, we are appealing that they resolve it as soon as possible because passengers come first. Without the passengers there is no airline. There is no industry and we need to start considering them before taking any decision.  
 He said the airlines operating in the MMA2 had incurred losses amounting to millions of naira since the strike began, adding that they still had to pay FAAN to process their passengers at the GAT. 
 Also, Mr Adebanji Ola, spokesman for Arik Air, said the airline, which operates its Port Harcourt flights out of MMA2 had temporary move it back to its hub at the GAT due to the strike. 
 We informed our Port Harcourt passengers since yesterday to go to our counter at GAT for boarding, pending when the strike will be called off,  he said. 
 Mr Frances Akinjole, General Secretary, ATSSSAN, said that the unions would continue to picket the terminal until the sacked workers were reinstated and the BASL management recognises the unions in the sector. 
 Akinjole also confirmed that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) and security agencies including the Assistant Inspector General, Lagos Airport Police Command, Mr Aminchi Baraya, had tried to intervene on the issue. 
 We will continue to barricade MMA2 until the management accede to our demands because what we are doing here is lawful,  he said. 
 The spokesperson for BASL, Mr Steve Omolale, however flayed the unions for the continued disruption of business activities and flights at the terminal despite being aware of the interim court order. 
 Omolale said BASL would not join issues with the unions since the matter was already before a competent court of jurisdiction in suit number FHC/L/CS/16412/18.",Aviation unions,bites,,,unknown,NA,,,,"The strike at the Murtala Muhammed Airport 2 (MMA2), Lagos, enters its second day and the bite has forced airline operators to make alternative arrangements to fly passengers.","The strike at the Murtala Muhammed Airport 2 (MMA2), Lagos, enters its second day and the bite has forced airline operators to make alternative arrangements to fly passengers.

Journalist’s arrest: Kogi NUJ protests,"The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Kogi council on Monday directed journalists in the state to boycott government activities to protest the unlawful arrest of one of its members, Mr Friday Ogungbemi. 
 The directive was contained in a communiqu issued in Lokoja after an emergency congress meeting following failure of all entreaties to the state government and Department of the State Services (DSS) to secure the release of Ogungbemi. 
 The Communiqu said that Ogungbemi, a publisher, was arrested by agents of the (DSS) on Wednesday night over alleged offensive publication in the November 23  December 15, 2016 edition of the Policy and Lawmakers magazine. 
 In view of the gross abuse of office by the DSS, probably acting on the directive of some highly placed groups or individuals, journalists should indefinitely boycott the coverage of all government activities in the state, the union directed. 
 According to the communiqu, the union views the detention of the journalist who was arrested on November 30, at his residence in Lokoja as an affront on the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the 1948 United Nations Human Rights Charter. 
 The NUJ noted with dismay, the ordeal of the publisher as well as the psychological trauma being experienced by his family. 
 The state council of the NUJ, having exhausted all avenues to secure the release of Mr Friday Ogungbemi, calls on the DSS, Kogi State, to secure his release without further delay as his arrest amounts to abuse of his fundamental Human Rights. 
 The NUJ, the communiqu said, considered the action of the law enforcement agency as an attempt to thwart the efforts of the media in the state and as well, muzzle the press from performing its function as watchdog of the society. 
 It noted that aggrieved persons had options available to them to explore rather than resort to illegal arrests and unwarranted detention of journalists using state security apparatus. 
 The congress also directed that a legal action be taken against the DSS with a view to enforcing the fundamental rights of the incarcerated journalist and as well, claim damages for his unlawful arrest and detention.",Nigeria Union of Journalists,arrest,,,government,NA,,,,"The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Kogi council on Monday directed journalists in the state to boycott government activities to protest the unlawful arrest of one of its members, Mr Friday Ogungbemi.","The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Kogi council on Monday directed journalists in the state to boycott government activities to protest the unlawful arrest of one of its members, Mr Friday Ogungbemi.

Mali Tuareg maintain independence claims,"Tuareg-led rebels who seized the north of Mali in April have denied reports that they were abandoning their claims for a separate state after the rebellion was hijacked by Islamist fighters. 
 Moussa Ag Assarid, spokesperson for the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), told Al Jazeera that the Tuareg group's demands have not changed.""The MNLA is not physically in every city in the Azawad, but that doesn't mean we don't exist … Azawad is a very large territory,"" he said.""We're open to any collaboration against terrorism … we're listening to the international community and are available for possible dialogue with Mali via mediator countries,"" he said.

Tuaregs claim 'independence' from Mali,"Tuareg rebels in northern Mali have proclaimed the ""independence of Azawad"" in a statement on their website and through a spokesperson in Paris. 
 ""We solemnly proclaim the independence of Azawad as from today,"" Mossa Ag Attaher said on Friday, adding that the rebels would respect ""the borders with other states"". 
 The Tuareg have declared the city of Gao as the capital of their new country. 
 Mali has been gripped by instability, following a coup by army officers in the capital Bamako and advances by Tuareg fighters and other armed groups that have seen a string of northern towns fall under their control in the broadly triangular area of desert in northern Mali 
 The MNLA statement on Friday stressed the group's ""firm commitment to create the conditions for lasting peace [and] to initiate the institutional foundations for a state based on a democratic constitution for an independent Azawad"". 
 Declaration questioned 
 However, the move was immediately questioned by the Ansar Dine, an Islamist group which also joined the fight against Malian government forces, who claim to be against independence. 
 Tuareg rebels claim the Azawad region of northern Mali 
 ""Our war is a holy war. It's a legal war in the name of Islam. We are against rebellions,"" Ansar Dine military chief Omar Hamaha said. 
 ""We are against independence. We are against revolutions not in the name of Islam."" 
 He was speaking in a video exclusively obtained by the AFP news agency and France 2 television filmed after the Islamist group's takeover of Timbuktu, where they have imposed Islamic law, forcing women to cover themselves and burning down bars. 
 Hamaha said they had ""more than 120 prisoners"" including thieves. 
 ""We have tied them up and taken their weapons. We beat them well and it's likely we will slit their throats,"" he added, while it was not clear if this threat was aimed at all prisoners. 
 In the city of Gao, Ansar Dine kidnapped seven Algerian diplomats, according to witnesses and the Algerian foreign ministry. 
 Ag Attaher, speaking on behalf of the MNLA, called the kidnapping ""deplorable"", adding that his group had been against that action but finally went along with the move so as to spare lives. 
 ""We are a liberation movement and we support the principles and values of democracy,"" he said. ""We distance ourselves completely from any Islamist movement and their fight for religious law."" 
 Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Bamako, said the information found on the Tuareg website goes to show the unprecedented feelings of honour and pride, ""after decades of suffering and wars are fights against what they describe as oppressive regimes."" 
 ""They say that finally they have an independent state, Azawad, and they will stick to that nation and fight for it until the last drop,"" he said. 
 He went on to say that since the international community does not seem convinced that an independent state is a realistic option, ""the Tuareg can still hope to achieve some sense of larger autonomy, which would still be a great victory for them."" 
 International condemnation 
 A series of international condemnations of the group's ""independence"" declaration rolled out as bodies around the world discussed the announcement. 
 Algerian consulate workers abducted 
 A statement from the office of Jean Ping, the African Union's commission chair, called the announcement ""null and of no value whatsoever"". 
 ""[Ping] calls on the international community as a whole to fully support this principled position of Africa,"" it said. 
 France, Mali's former colonial ruler, dismissed the declaration of independence, French defence minister Gerard Longuet said. 
 ""A unilateral declaration of independence which is not recognised by African states would not have any meaning for us,"" Longuet told the Reuters news agency. 
 Ahmed Ouyahia, Algeria's prime minister, was quoted by France's Le Monde newspaper as saying the neighbouring country would ""never accept questioning Mali's territorial integrity"". 
 The UK Foreign Office released a statement saying they had temporarily suspended all in-country services, including consular services, and withdrawn their staff from the embassy in Bamako. 
 Alessandra Giuffrida, an anthropologist in the African Studies Department at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the UK, psoke to Al Jazeera about the legality of creating an independent state for the Tuaregs. 
 ""They are taking advantage of a new situation, which is the lack of a constitutional government in Bamako, which means the MNLA was able to claim, according to international law, independence, and this is a new fact which has never occurred before in the history of the Tuareg,"" she said. 
 ""According to international law experts, this actually gives the Tuareg some ground to fight legally for the independence of their state."" 
 Giuffrida said the reaction of the international community was important because ""they have an interest in maintaining the status quo"". 
 ""There is economic interest in the north of the country after the discovery of mineral resources,"" she said. 
 'Strange situation' 
 ""The coup leaders were of the view that they would get more support from the people because of the failure of the military establishment to cope with the situation,"" said Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Bamako. 
 ""But they suddenly found themselves in a strange situation - the coup leaders lost control of half of the country, and they're now hoping for international support."" 
 The MNLA, which on Thursday said it had halted military operations as a result of their capture of the Azawad, called on the international community to recognise its independence. 
 ""We completely accept the role and responsibility that behoves us to secure this territory,"" Ag Attaher said. ""We have ended a very important fight, that of liberation ... now the biggest task commences."" 
 But a Malian military source told the AFP news agency that Ansar Dine leader Iyad Ag Ghaly wielded more power in the north, with the backing of alleged regional al-Qaeda fighters. 
 ""From what we know, the MNLA is in charge of nothing at the moment ... it is Iyad who is the strongest and he is with AQIM,"" the source said, referring to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. 
 Salafist flag 
 Witnesses told AFP that raiders had hoisted the black Salafist flag that has been the emblem of rebels who had overrun Gao, Timbuktu and other northern towns. 
 Amnesty International warned that north Mali was on the brink of a ""major humanitarian disaster"" while Oxfam and World Vision said crippling sanctions against the junta could have devastating consequences. 
 ""All the food and medicine stored by major aid agencies has been looted and most of the aid workers have fled,"" said Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's researcher on west Africa. 
 ""The population is at imminent risk of severe food and medical shortages  that could lead to many casualties especially among women and children who are less able to fend for themselves.""

 ""We solemnly proclaim the independence of Azawad as from today,"" Mossa Ag Attaher said on Friday, adding that the rebels would respect ""the borders with other states"". 
 The Tuareg have declared the city of Gao as the capital of their new country. 
 Mali has been gripped by instability, following a coup by army officers in the capital Bamako and advances by Tuareg fighters and other armed groups that have seen a string of northern towns fall under their control in the broadly triangular area of desert in northern Mali 
 The MNLA statement on Friday stressed the group's ""firm commitment to create the conditions for lasting peace [and] to initiate the institutional foundations for a state based on a democratic constitution for an independent Azawad"". 
 Declaration questioned 
 However, the move was immediately questioned by the Ansar Dine, an Islamist group which also joined the fight against Malian government forces, who claim to be against independence. 
 Tuareg rebels claim the Azawad region of northern Mali 
 ""Our war is a holy war. It's a legal war in the name of Islam. We are against rebellions,"" Ansar Dine military chief Omar Hamaha said. 
 ""We are against independence. We are against revolutions not in the name of Islam."" 
 He was speaking in a video exclusively obtained by the AFP news agency and France 2 television filmed after the Islamist group's takeover of Timbuktu, where they have imposed Islamic law, forcing women to cover themselves and burning down bars. 
 Hamaha said they had ""more than 120 prisoners"" including thieves. 
 ""We have tied them up and taken their weapons. We beat them well and it's likely we will slit their throats,"" he added, while it was not clear if this threat was aimed at all prisoners. 
 In the city of Gao, Ansar Dine kidnapped seven Algerian diplomats, according to witnesses and the Algerian foreign ministry. 
 Ag Attaher, speaking on behalf of the MNLA, called the kidnapping ""deplorable"", adding that his group had been against that action but finally went along with the move so as to spare lives. 
 ""We are a liberation movement and we support the principles and values of democracy,"" he said. ""We distance ourselves completely from any Islamist movement and their fight for religious law."" 
 Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Bamako, said the information found on the Tuareg website goes to show the unprecedented feelings of honour and pride, ""after decades of suffering and wars are fights against what they describe as oppressive regimes."" 
 ""They say that finally they have an independent state, Azawad, and they will stick to that nation and fight for it until the last drop,"" he said. 
 He went on to say that since the international community does not seem convinced that an independent state is a realistic option, ""the Tuareg can still hope to achieve some sense of larger autonomy, which would still be a great victory for them."" 
 International condemnation 
 A series of international condemnations of the group's ""independence"" declaration rolled out as bodies around the world discussed the announcement. 
 Algerian consulate workers abducted 
 A statement from the office of Jean Ping, the African Union's commission chair, called the announcement ""null and of no value whatsoever"". 
 ""[Ping] calls on the international community as a whole to fully support this principled position of Africa,"" it said. 
 France, Mali's former colonial ruler, dismissed the declaration of independence, French defence minister Gerard Longuet said. 
 ""A unilateral declaration of independence which is not recognised by African states would not have any meaning for us,"" Longuet told the Reuters news agency. 
 Ahmed Ouyahia, Algeria's prime minister, was quoted by France's Le Monde newspaper as saying the neighbouring country would ""never accept questioning Mali's territorial integrity"". 
 The UK Foreign Office released a statement saying they had temporarily suspended all in-country services, including consular services, and withdrawn their staff from the embassy in Bamako. 
 Alessandra Giuffrida, an anthropologist in the African Studies Department at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the UK, psoke to Al Jazeera about the legality of creating an independent state for the Tuaregs. 
 ""They are taking advantage of a new situation, which is the lack of a constitutional government in Bamako, which means the MNLA was able to claim, according to international law, independence, and this is a new fact which has never occurred before in the history of the Tuareg,"" she said. 
 ""According to international law experts, this actually gives the Tuareg some ground to fight legally for the independence of their state."" 
 Giuffrida said the reaction of the international community was important because ""they have an interest in maintaining the status quo"". 
 ""There is economic interest in the north of the country after the discovery of mineral resources,"" she said. 
 'Strange situation' 
 ""The coup leaders were of the view that they would get more support from the people because of the failure of the military establishment to cope with the situation,"" said Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Bamako. 
 ""But they suddenly found themselves in a strange situation - the coup leaders lost control of half of the country, and they're now hoping for international support."" 
 The MNLA, which on Thursday said it had halted military operations as a result of their capture of the Azawad, called on the international community to recognise its independence. 
 ""We completely accept the role and responsibility that behoves us to secure this territory,"" Ag Attaher said. ""We have ended a very important fight, that of liberation ... now the biggest task commences."" 
 But a Malian military source told the AFP news agency that Ansar Dine leader Iyad Ag Ghaly wielded more power in the north, with the backing of alleged regional al-Qaeda fighters. 
 ""From what we know, the MNLA is in charge of nothing at the moment ... it is Iyad who is the strongest and he is with AQIM,"" the source said, referring to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. 
 Salafist flag 
 Witnesses told AFP that raiders had hoisted the black Salafist flag that has been the emblem of rebels who had overrun Gao, Timbuktu and other northern towns. 
 Amnesty International warned that north Mali was on the brink of a ""major humanitarian disaster"" while Oxfam and World Vision said crippling sanctions against the junta could have devastating consequences. 
 ""All the food and medicine stored by major aid agencies has been looted and most of the aid workers have fled,"" said Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's researcher on west Africa. 
 ""The population is at imminent risk of severe food and medical shortages  that could lead to many casualties especially among women and children who are less able to fend for themselves.""

Hindu extremists challenge Kashmir's 'special status',"A Hindu right-wing group's proposal to amend Article 35A of the Indian constitution is being viewed in India-administered Kashmir as an attempt to undermine the special status of the volatile state that is in the throes of a violent separatist insurgency. 
 This constitutional privilege, which was introduced through a presidential order in 1954, accords special rights and privileges to the Jammu and Kashmir citizens and denies property rights to people who come to live in the state. 
 The constitutional provision grants Kashmir a unique status within India that allows the state to have its own constitution, a separate flag and autonomy in all matters except foreign affairs, defense and communications. 
 Article 35A also allows the state legislature to define the list of ""permanent residents,"" who are eligible to vote, work for the state government, own land, secure public employment and college admissions. 
 Its legality has been challenged by a right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-backed think tank, the Jammu and Kashmir Study Center, and a non-governmental organization, We the Citizens, demanding the provision be struck down due to its ""unconstitutional character."" The groups have filed a petition in the Indian Supreme Court, arguing the special provisions are discriminatory. 
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is the ideological arm of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). 
 A further challenge to the Kashmir status has been mounted by a lawyer, Charu Wali Khanna, on the basis of gender discrimination. 
 The petitions are widely seen in Kashmir as an attempt by right-wing Hindu nationalist groups to alter Kashmir's demography. 
 ""It will be an assault on the Muslim identity of Jammu and Kashmir and could change the demographic character of the state,"" lawyer Zaffar Shah told DW. 
 ""If the provision is amended, all hell will break lose. The fragile relationship that Kashmir enjoys with New Delhi will be broken forever,"" political analyst Basheer Manzar told DW. 
 - India's partition and 70 years of proxy jihad 
 - The Islamization of Kashmir's separatist movement 
 India's top court is contemplating setting up a bench to verify the validity of the provision. 
 ""When the constitutional validity of an article is under challenge, it has to be referred to a constitutional bench under Article 145,"" said Supreme Court judges Dipak Misra and A.M. Khanwilkar earlier this week. 
 On February 27, Pakistan's military said that it had shot down two Indian fighter jets over disputed Kashmir. A Pakistani military spokesman said the jets were shot down after they'd entered Pakistani airspace. It is the first time in history that two nuclear-armed powers have conducted air strikes against each other. 
 The Pakistani military has released this image to show that Indian warplanes struck inside Pakistani territory for the first time since the countries went to war in 1971. India said the air strike was in response to a recent suicide attack on Indian troops based in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan said there were no casualties and that its airforce repelled India's aircraft. 
 Some Indian civil society members believe New Delhi cannot exonerate itself from responsibility by accusing Islamabad of creating unrest in the Kashmir valley. A number of rights organizations demand that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government reduce the number of troops in Kashmir and let the people decide their fate. 
 On February 14, at least 41 Indian paramilitary police were killed in a suicide bombing near the capital of India-administered Kashmir. The Pakistan-based Jihadi group, Jaish-e-Mohammad, claimed responsibility. The attack, the worst on Indian troops since the insurgency in Kashmir began in 1989, spiked tensions and triggered fears of an armed confrontation between the two nuclear-armed powers. 
 Since 1989, Muslim insurgents have been fighting Indian forces in the Indian-administered part of Kashmir - a region of 12 million people, about 70 percent of whom are Muslim. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. 
 In October 2016, the Indian military has launched an offensive against armed rebels in Kashmir, surrounding at least 20 villages in Shopian district. New Delhi accused Islamabad of backing the militants, who cross over the Pakistani-Indian ""Line of Control"" and launch attacks on India's paramilitary forces. 
 The security situation in the Indian part of Kashmir deteriorated after the killing of Burhan Wani, a young separatist leader, in July 2016. Protests against Indian rule and clashes between separatists and soldiers have claimed hundreds of lives since then. 
 In September 2016, Islamist militants killed at least 17 Indian soldiers and wounded 30 in India-administered Kashmir. The Indian army said the rebels had infiltrated the Indian part of Kashmir from Pakistan, with initial investigations suggesting that the militants belonged to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad group, which has been active in Kashmir for over a decade. 
 Indian authorities banned a number of social media websites in Kashmir after video clips showing troops committing grave human rights violations went viral on the Internet. One such video that showed a Kashmiri protester tied to an Indian army jeep - apparently as a human shield - generated outrage on social media. 
 Those in favor of an independent Kashmir want Pakistan and India to step aside and let the Kashmiri people decide their future. ""It is time India and Pakistan announce the timetable for withdrawal of their forces from the portions they control and hold an internationally supervised referendum,"" Toqeer Gilani, the president of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front in Pakistani Kashmir, told DW. 
 But most Kashmir observers don't see it happening in the near future. They say that while the Indian strategy to deal strictly with militants and separatists in Kashmir has partly worked out, sooner or later New Delhi will have to find a political solution to the crisis. Secession, they say, does not stand a chance.

 Angry reactions 
 ""The special status of the state is enshrined in the constitution and it cannot be tampered with or removed. It is an article of faith. Both provisions are two sides of the same coin,"" said Omar Abdullah, a former Kashmir chief minister. 
 Fears that the special status could be in jeopardy has galvanized the region's political parties, including the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the opposition National Conference. 
 Prominent separatist leaders, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik, have also threatened to stage protest rallies if the RSS tried to change Kashmir's status. 
 The controversy could plunge India-administered Kashmir into further turmoil as the Himalayan region has been in the grip of violence since July 2016. 
 ""All political parties are concerned. Questioning Article 35A is synonymous with questioning the accession of Jammu and Kashmir. It is very serious,"" Ali Mohammad Sagar, a National Conference legislator, told DW. 
 A ticking time bomb 
 Kashmir's Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, whose PDP party is in an alliance with the BJP, has slammed the move and said the Kashmiri political parties would jointly oppose it. 
 ""The state [Kashmir] is like a jewel in a crown and it should remain like this. There are people who want to take us back to the pre-independence era. There are people in the country who want to create trouble and take us back to 1947,"" Mufti said in her Independence Day speech on August 15. 
 The BJP says the residents of Kashmir should be given a chance to hold a referendum whether they want Article 35A to remain in the constitution or not. 
 ""The PDP and the National Conference are only trying to play up fear,"" Pawan Rana, the BJP state secretary, told DW. 
 Memories of the Amarnath Shrine row are fresh in the valley. In 2008, a violent clash erupted when the state government promised to give a piece of land to a trust that administers the Amarnath Shrine. Clashes erupted following the proposal and snowballed into one of the biggest pro-independence demonstrations in Kashmir killing 40 people and injuring hundreds. The government eventually had to withdraw the proposal.

 In 1947, British India was divided into two countries - India and Pakistan. Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah and his All-India Muslim League party had first demanded autonomy for Muslim-majority areas in the undivided India, and only later a separate country for Muslims. Jinnah believed that Hindus and Muslims could not continue to live together, as they were distinctly different ""nations."" 
 The partition of British India was extremely violent. Following the birth of India and Pakistan, violent communal riots began in many western areas, mostly in Punjab. Historians say that more than a million people died in clashes, and millions more migrated from Indian territory to Pakistan and from the Pakistani side to India. 
 India and Pakistan clashed over Kashmir soon after their independence. The Muslim-majority Kashmir region was ruled by a Hindu leader, but Jinnah wanted it to be part of Pakistani territory. Indian and Pakistani troops fought in Kashmir in 1948, with India taking control of most part of the valley, while Pakistan occupied a smaller area. India and Pakistan continue to clash over Kashmir. 
 Liberal historians say that Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi wanted cordial ties between newly independent states. Jinnah, for instance, believed that ties between India and Pakistan should be similar to those between the US and Canada. But after his death in 1948, his successors followed a collision course with New Delhi. 
 Indian and Pakistani governments present very different accounts of the partition. While India emphasizes the Indian National Congress' freedom movement against British rulers - with Gandhi as its main architect - Pakistani textbooks focus on a ""struggle"" against both British and Hindu ""oppression."" State propaganda in both countries paints each other as an ""enemy"" that cannot be trusted. 
 Diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan have remained acrimonious for the past seven decades. The issue of Islamist terrorism has marred relations in the last few years, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of backing Islamist jihadists to wage a war in India-administered Kashmir. India also blames Pakistan-based groups for launching terror attacks on Indian soil. Islamabad denies these claims. 
 Many young people in both India and Pakistan are urging their governments to improve bilateral ties. Islamabad-based documentary filmmaker Wajahat Malik believes the best way for India and Pakistan to develop a closer relationship is through more interaction between their peoples. ""Trade and tourism are the way forward for us. When people come together, the states will follow suit,"" Malik told DW.

"Red card for Saraki, Dogara: Leave APC or  be expelled","A founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the partys deputy publicity secretary have offered a friendly advice to both Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara: to quit APC without delay or be expelled. 
 Abu Ibrahim who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Police Affairs and an ally of President Muhammadu Buhari and APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary Yekini Nabena gave the advice on Wednesday. 
 Ibrahim said the failure of Saraki and Dogara to leave the party would lead to their expulsion. 
 The Senator, who represents Katsina South Senatorial District, also said the plot to impeach President Buhari would have begun today (Thursday) as planned by some lawmakers. 
 Ibrahim, who appeared to have spoken the minds of other APC senators, said developments in and around the National Assembly clearly showed that Saraki and Dogara could no longer be trusted in the APC. 
 The expulsion calls came as President Buhari met last night with APC senators following Tuesdays defection of 14 senators and 37 members of the House of Representatives from the party to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP and the African Democratic Congress (ADC). 
 With Senators Lanre Tejusoso and Adesoji Akanbi returning to APC, the APC now has 54 members as against PDPs 48 in the Senate. 
 According to The Nation, Abu Ibrahim who is also chairman of Buhari Support Group, spoke in Abuja. 
 Speaking specifically about the defection of 14 senators and 37 House of Representatives members from the APC, Ibrahim said the defections were not only expected but did not come to him as a shock. 
 He said he concluded that no fewer than 13 senators would leave the APC. 
 He noted that the only defection he did not anticipate was Sokoto State Senator Abdullahi Danbabas. 
 I I know that those who take Saraki like god will go. This is because wherever Saraki goes they will go. But the mistake they have made is not to realise that politics is local. 
 Nobody will say Isa Misau and Suleiman Nazif (two Bauchi State senators) were voted because of Saraki. They were voted because of Buhari. They will lose their seats. Saraki will not save them. They cant even go to their constituencies. 
 On the speculation that some APC senators were quartered in a high profile hotel in Abuja on the night preceding Tuesdays Senate plenary to plot change of leadership in the Senate, Ibrahim said: I slept in my house. I was here in my office and left by 2pm. I was not quartered anywhere. 
 He was categorical that the alleged plot to impeach President Buhari would have started on Thursday (today) 
 He said: The impeachment of the President should have started Thursday. Everybody was planning. We knew they were planning. 
 They realised and learnt that we knew. They knew that if they had remained up till today (Wednesday) a lot of things would have happened. 
 We were planning. This is the National Assembly, the only place political parties meet. We were planning. 
 Saraki and Dogara should resign today or the APC should send them away. They are no longer APC members. 
 The only reason Saraki and Dogara have not left the APC is that they know that if they leave they will lose their seats. But we will force them to leave. 
 Left to me, I will recommend to APC to expel them. They are no longer needed in the party. We will be cured of cancer if they leave. 
 Me as Abu Ibrahim, I am asking Saraki and Dogara to leave APC today. I will meet Oshiomhole (Adams) to expel them. 
 Ibrahim insisted that the departure of Saraki and Dogara will not affect the electoral chances of APC. 
 He noted that if Saraki leaves APC, the party may lose Kwara and Kogi states and no more. 
 Ibrahim continued: My position is that Saraki and Dogara should leave the APC. We can no longer trust or discuss APC issues with them again. We cannot afford to continue to harbour moles in our midst. 
 Let people be courageous enough and be honest to themselves. We will not miss them. 
 APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary Yekini Nabena, also called for an immediate expulsion of the Senate President. 
 In a statement, Nabena accused Saraki of being in cahoots with the defectors. 
 He said: Being the ringleader, there was no justification for APC to continue to tolerate Saraki. He must go now. Or be shown the way out. 
 Nabena, who said the party leadership and members were not surprised by the defections, said the people were rather shocked by Sarakis utterances and body language. 
 The news of the about 14 senators who defected from our party hardly came as a surprise to anyone. What, however, shocked political observers, especially democratic minds, was Senate President Bukola Sarakis postures and expressions, which clearly communicated his unhidden complicity in the charade against his supposed party. 
 Clearly, Saraki had a big hand in organising the events that transpired in the National Assembly. He has, therefore, lost the moral justification to remain in APC. The time to expel him from the party is now.",founding member of the All Progressives Congress,card,,,Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara,Red card for Saraki,,,,A founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the partys deputy publicity secretary have offered a friendly advice to both Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara: to quit APC without delay or be expelled.,"A founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the partys deputy publicity secretary have offered a friendly advice to both Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara: to quit APC without delay or be expelled.

 The expulsion calls came as President Buhari met last night with APC senators following Tuesdays defection of 14 senators and 37 members of the House of Representatives from the party to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP and the African Democratic Congress (ADC). 
 With Senators Lanre Tejusoso and Adesoji Akanbi returning to APC, the APC now has 54 members as against PDPs 48 in the Senate. 
 According to The Nation, Abu Ibrahim who is also chairman of Buhari Support Group, spoke in Abuja. 
 Speaking specifically about the defection of 14 senators and 37 House of Representatives members from the APC, Ibrahim said the defections were not only expected but did not come to him as a shock. 
 He said he concluded that no fewer than 13 senators would leave the APC. 
 He noted that the only defection he did not anticipate was Sokoto State Senator Abdullahi Danbabas. 
 I I know that those who take Saraki like god will go. This is because wherever Saraki goes they will go. But the mistake they have made is not to realise that politics is local. 
 Nobody will say Isa Misau and Suleiman Nazif (two Bauchi State senators) were voted because of Saraki. They were voted because of Buhari. They will lose their seats. Saraki will not save them. They cant even go to their constituencies. 
 On the speculation that some APC senators were quartered in a high profile hotel in Abuja on the night preceding Tuesdays Senate plenary to plot change of leadership in the Senate, Ibrahim said: I slept in my house. I was here in my office and left by 2pm. I was not quartered anywhere. 
 He was categorical that the alleged plot to impeach President Buhari would have started on Thursday (today) 
 He said: The impeachment of the President should have started Thursday. Everybody was planning. We knew they were planning. 
 They realised and learnt that we knew. They knew that if they had remained up till today (Wednesday) a lot of things would have happened. 
 We were planning. This is the National Assembly, the only place political parties meet. We were planning. 
 Saraki and Dogara should resign today or the APC should send them away. They are no longer APC members. 
 The only reason Saraki and Dogara have not left the APC is that they know that if they leave they will lose their seats. But we will force them to leave. 
 Left to me, I will recommend to APC to expel them. They are no longer needed in the party. We will be cured of cancer if they leave. 
 Me as Abu Ibrahim, I am asking Saraki and Dogara to leave APC today. I will meet Oshiomhole (Adams) to expel them. 
 Ibrahim insisted that the departure of Saraki and Dogara will not affect the electoral chances of APC. 
 He noted that if Saraki leaves APC, the party may lose Kwara and Kogi states and no more. 
 Ibrahim continued: My position is that Saraki and Dogara should leave the APC. We can no longer trust or discuss APC issues with them again. We cannot afford to continue to harbour moles in our midst. 
 Let people be courageous enough and be honest to themselves. We will not miss them. 
 APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary Yekini Nabena, also called for an immediate expulsion of the Senate President. 
 In a statement, Nabena accused Saraki of being in cahoots with the defectors. 
 He said: Being the ringleader, there was no justification for APC to continue to tolerate Saraki. He must go now. Or be shown the way out. 
 Nabena, who said the party leadership and members were not surprised by the defections, said the people were rather shocked by Sarakis utterances and body language. 
 The news of the about 14 senators who defected from our party hardly came as a surprise to anyone. What, however, shocked political observers, especially democratic minds, was Senate President Bukola Sarakis postures and expressions, which clearly communicated his unhidden complicity in the charade against his supposed party. 
 Clearly, Saraki had a big hand in organising the events that transpired in the National Assembly. He has, therefore, lost the moral justification to remain in APC. The time to expel him from the party is now.",founding member of the All Progressives Congress,member,,,Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara,founding member of the All Progressives Congress,,
"APC Kwara: Ishola Fulani remains expelled, candidates duly elected","The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the Ishola Balogun Fulani-led executive of the partys Kwara chapter remains dissolved and Ishola Fulani himself expelled. 
 Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu,APC, National Publicity Secretary of the party made the clarification  in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja. 
 His clarification came on the tail of a judgment by a Kwara court, affirming the legality of the Ishola Balogun Fulani executive, and also endorsing the candidates picked during the state-organised primary for the 2019 election.  
 We wish to restate the NWC decision to expel the erstwhile Ishola Balogun Fulani-led APC Executive in Kwara State. 
 This, he said was  in view of widespread misinterpretations given to a judgement of an Ilorin High Court on Wednesday. 
 He explained that the decision to expel Ishola Balogun Fulani and others was well within the powers of the NWC which investigated and deliberated on the anti-party activities of the sacked state executive. 
 He said that direct primaries were used to elect party candidates for Kwara State, hence State executives had no role to play in the primaries. 
 He further explained that only candidates that emerged from the direct primary exercise conducted by the NWC inaugurated committee was submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

Kenyan and Somali troops surround Kismayo,"Hundreds of Somali and Kenyan armed forces have surrounded the southern port city of Kismayo, a former rebel stronghold, Al Jazeera has learned.The troops surrounded Kismayo on Monday but residents said earlier that some of the soldiers had entered the city. 
 ""What happened earlier is that a group of 30 to 45 Somali government troops went into the town, had a meal at a few open restaurants and left the town,"" Al Jazeera's Mohamed Adow reported from the Kenyan capital Nairobi. 
 ""Somali government forces and the African Union peace keeping mission, which the Kenyan forces are fighting under, have surrounded Kismayo and have not gone in.""Mohamud Farah, the spokesperson for Somali forces in the southern Juba area, said: ""We have sent 450 [troops] to patrol the town and settle in the police headquarters."" 
 Witnesses said the forces were taking up positions in the city. 
 ""They arrived from the west of the city and are taking up positions,"" said Aden Ismail, a local trader.'Fed up with misrule' 
 Asha Mohamed Aden, a seller of second-hand clothing, said she had seen ""heavily armed Kenyans"" along with Somali officers. 
 ""Some people are happy to welcome them because they were fed up with the misrule of the al-Shabab fighters,"" another resident, Abdullahi Farey Hassan, told the AFP news agency. ""But I will have my reservations until I see them doing something good. I hope they will be better than al-Shabab."" 
 Al-Shabab rebels had earlier vacated Somalia's second largest city after a surprise assault by sea, air and ground forces from the Kenyan and Somali military that began on Friday. 
 Commanders for the group told Al Jazeera that their forces withdrew in order to avoid conflict in the streets, but said that their group had not abandoned the town, and would continue fighting for it. 
 Al-shabab said its fighters were poised to engage the allied troops once they entered the city centre, threatening to turn the streets into a ""battlefield"". 
 Members of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which totals 17,000 soldiers across the country, had been cautious about pouring into the port city from its outskirts. 
 Farah, the Somali military spokesperson, said earlier that AU forces were wary of the threat of landmines laid by the rebels. 
 ""Every step in Kismayo is sandy. We anticipate mines have been planted,"" he said. 
 On Saturday, Hussein Arab Isse, Somalia's deputy prime minister and defence minister, told Al Jazeera that AU forces had been waiting for peace negotiations with local tribal elders to end before entering the city. 
 'Major blow' 
 In the past four weeks, fearing an assault by the Kenyans, an estimated 12,000 people have fled the city, whose total population is estimated at between 160,000 and 190,000. 
 Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the newly elected Somali president, praised the AU peacekeeping force on Monday for forcing al-Shabab to vacate the city. 
 ""We commend AMISOM and the Somali troops who have shown bravery by forcing the enemy out of the town,"" a statement from the president's office said.

 ""We believe that this will help to bring about a return to stability in Somalia, and reduce over time the terrorist threat to Somalia and neighbouring states."" 
 Carson called Somalia ""a good news story for the region"", pointing to the nation's new constitution and newly elected parliament and president, after years of lawlessness. 
 Kismayo was al-Shabab's last stronghold in the country, and the taxes it levied on goods coming into the port helped to fund the rebellion against the Somali government. 
 The African Union force is made up of Ugandan and Burundian troops, who pushed al-Shabab out of Mogadishu in August 2011, and forces from Djibouti and Kenya. Carson said troops from Sierra Leone would arrive in Somalia on Monday and Tuesday to bolster AMISOM.",Kenyan and Somali troops,explosions,,,al-Shabab,Several explosions have rocked Somalia 's southern port city of Kismayo,,
Kenya opposition plans fresh rally," 
 Kenya's opposition has said that it will hold a mass rally of thousands of its supporters in a park in Nairobi, the capital, on Friday.Raila Odinga, the opposition leader, had called for a ""million man march"" on Thursday to protest against Mwai Kibaki's re-election in the December 27 vote, insisting the poll was rigged. 
 But when thousands of his supporters left the capital's slums to march to the rally, they were stopped by police using tear gas, water cannon and live ammunition. 
  
 Haru Mutasa reports on minority tribes being forced from their homes 
 There were no immediate reports of casualties in Thursday's clashes with police.A week of post-election violence has killed more than 300 people and threatens to destroy Kenya's reputation as one of Africa's most promising democracies and strongest economies. 
 Kibaki said on Thursday that he was ""deeply disturbed by the senseless violence"" and was ready to hold talks with ""concerned parties once the nation is calm"". 
 He read a statement to reporters, but did not take questions. 
 Genocide charges 
 Earlier, hundreds of politicians supporting Kibaki urged the International Criminal Court to bring genocide charges against the opposition.""We are calling for ... the indicting of Orange Democratic Movement leaders by the International Criminal Court on charges of ethnic cleansing and genocide,"" Mohammed Yusuf Haji, an MP, said reading from a statement.

As such, he said it was important to have outside judges deciding on who the winner is or whether to hold another election especially after electoral officials said they saw documents being tampered with.

French hostage 'executed' in Mali,"A French hostage has been executed in Mali, a man claiming to be a spokesman for al-Qaeda in North Africa has told Mauritania's ANI news agency. 
 A French foreign office spokesman said on Tuesday that Paris was trying to verify the report of the killing of Philippe Verdon, who was kidnapped in November 2011, adding that ""we don't know at the moment"" whether it was reliable. 
 The private Mauritanian news agency reported that someone calling himself Al-Qairawani and claiming to be a spokesman for al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) group told them that the ""spy"" Verdon had been executed ""on March 10 in response to France's intervention in Northern Mali"". 
 ""The French President (Francois) Hollande is responsible for the lives of the other French hostages,"" he warned. 
 In all 15 French nationals, including Verdon, are being held captive in Africa, with AQIM claiming responsibility for six of the kidnappings. 
 Refusal to pay ransom 
 Verdon was seized on the night of November 24, 2011 along with Serge Lazarevic. According to their families the two men had been on a business trip and were kidnapped from their hotel in Hombori, northeast Mali. 
 The families denied that the two men were mercenaries or secret service agents. 
 AQIM swiftly claimed responsibility for the kidnappings and in August last year a video showing Verdon describing the ""difficult living conditions"" was released on a Mauritanian website. 
 The hostages' families have in recent weeks expressed growing fears for their loved ones in the light of France's military actions in Mali. 
 Earlier Tuesday, Verdon's father Jean-Pierre Verdon complained that the families were hearing nothing from the French authorities. 
 ""We are in a total fog and it is impossible to live this way,"" he told RTL radio. ""We have no information."" 
 Asked about France's refusal to pay ransoms to kidnappers, Verdon senior replied that the families had no say in such ""decisions of state"". 
 Paris deployed forces in Mali on January 11 to help stop al-Qaeda linked fighters who had controlled the north of the country since April 2012 from moving southward and threatening the capital Bamako. 
 Pockets of resistance 
 France now has more than 4,000 troops on the ground in Mali, of whom about 1,200 are currently deployed in the northeast, carrying out operations after driving out most of the rebels from the area. 
 There are still pockets of resistance in areas such as Gao, which have witnessed stray attacks and suicide bombings since the rebels fled. 
 The French troops in the region are backed up by African forces. Soldiers from Chad, whose experience and training has made them key in the French-led offensive, have also suffered casualties with at least 26 deaths. 
 On Tuesday the French army announced that 15 rebel fighters had been killed in recent days in the northern Mali region of Gao, with the seizure of a large cache of arms and ammunition. 
 The AQIM source cited by the Mauritanian news agency refused to confirm reports that top rebels, Mokhtar Belmokhtar and Abdelhamid Abou Zeid had been killed in Mali earlier this month.

Nigerian army suspected of killing civilians,"Nigerian soldiers have reportedly killed 16 men in the country's northeast just hours after they were arrested leaving a mosque, according to nurses at a hospital that received the bodies. 
 Troops rounded up 17 people, including a Muslim religious leader, as they left morning prayers at a mosque on Wednesday from the Dogo Tebo area of Potiskum in Yobe state. 
 Residents and hospital staff said the bodies of 16 men were found dead with bullet wounds. 
 ""All the bodies have gunshot wounds on them,"" a nurse speaking on condition of anonymity said. 
 Residents said the Muslim religious leader was not among the dead, and said they were ""worried about what they could do to him"". 
 Community leaders believe the 16 men were picked up and killed because all of them were from the Kanuri ethnic group that forms the bulk of Boko Haram's membership. 
 ""We demand a probe into this unjustifiable murder,"" said one community leader, adding ""our fear is we don't know what they will do next"". 
 Extra-judicial killings 
 Human rights groups in Nigeria and abroad have previously accused the military of carrying out extra-judicial killings in the fight against Boko Haram. 
 Amnesty International, the UK-based rights monitor, said in March that there was ""credible evidence"" that more than 600 people were summarily executed in the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, after a Boko Haram jail break. 
 Concerns have also been expressed about atrocities perpetrated by vigilantes, who have assisted the military against Boko Haram. 
 On Friday vigilantes in the Borno town of Biu said they and troops had decapitated 41 Boko Haram fighters who were planning a raid in the village of Sabon Gari, in the south of the state. 
 Two residents said the heads were put on spikes and paraded through the town. 
 ""It was like hunters displaying their game after a hunting expedition,"" Silas Buba, a resident, said. 
 Human Rights Watch, the US-based rights monitor, said the alleged beheadings were consistent with the vigilantes' recent conduct. 
 Formed in 2002, Boko Haram is against Western education and has been battling the government in the country's north and has repeatedly attacked schools, churches, mosques and markets as it seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Islam in territory it controls.

Mali unwed couple 'stoned to death',"Islamists occupying the northern Mali town of Aguelhok have stoned an unmarried couple to death in front of about 200 people, two local government officials said. 
 The incident, which reportedly took place on Sunday, is the first reported sharia killing since they occupied the area, ratcheting up pressure on an embattled interim government. 
 ""I was there. The Islamists took the unmarried couple to the centre of Aguelhok. The couple was placed in two holes and the Islamists stoned them to death,"" a local government official told the AFP news agency on condition of anonymity. 
 ""The woman fainted after the first few blows,"" he said, adding that the man had shouted out once and then fallen silent. 
 A second official confirmed the information, saying the couple had two children, the youngest of which was six months old. 
 ""They were living in the bush; they were brought to town by the Islamists who stoned them to death. People came out to watch, there were witnesses,"" he said, also not wishing to be identified. 
 'Al-Qaeda tactics' 
 The small town in the region of Kidal near the Algerian border was one of the first to be captured by Tuareg separatists rebels on January 24. 
 Some 82 civilians and soldiers were summarily executed, France said earlier this year, accusing the rebels of using al-Qaeda style tactics. 
 The Tuareg rebellion sparked a coup d’état in March by angry and overwhelmed soldiers, but the chaos only allowed the desert nomads and Islamists fighting on their flanks to seize the country's north, an area larger than France. 
 The Islamist groups, which experts say are acting under the aegis of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) have since chased out the Tuareg separatists and are firmly in control of the region. 
 AQIM allies Ansar Dine (Defenders of Faith) are holding Aguelhok.

Mali Islamist group 'kills Algerian diplomat',"An armed religious movement that has taken control of large swathes of Mali has claimed to have executed an Algerian diplomat who was kidnapped during their takeover of northern Mali, according to a statement published by a Mauritanian news agency. 
 Taher Touati, the Algerian vice-consul, ""was executed this [Sunday] morning at dawn"" read the statement from the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa [MUJAO] published by online news agency ANI, known for carrying reliable information on extremist groups in the region. 
 ""The Algerian government must take complete responsibility for the consequences of its stubbornness and the misguided and irresponsible decisions of its president and its generals,"" read the statement. 
 Al Jazeera has been unable to independently authenticate the origin of the statement. 
 The Algerian foreign ministry was investigating the opposition fighters' claim. As of Sunday afternoon, Touati's family told the Algerian daily newspaper El Watan that they did not yet have any confirmation. 
 MUJAO had on August 24 given an ultimatum to Algeria, threatening to kill the hostage after Algiers said that they rejected its demands for the release of prisoners affiliated with the movement in a hostage swap. 
 MUJAO has claimed the April 5 kidnapping of seven Algerian diplomats from a consulate in the town of Gao. 
 A video MUJAO released on August 26 showed one of the four remaining hostages pleading with the government to save his life. 
 The wife of one hostage called on MUJAO to free them in a statement published by the Algerian press on Sunday, saying they were only ""innocent civil servants"", and urged President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to work for their release. 
 Three of the hostages were freed in July. 
 Alessandra Giuffrida, an anthropologist at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London who specialises in the Tuareg of northern Mali, said that MUJAO ""possibly"" had links to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and had no links with the Tuareg movement. 
 ""One has to be quite careful about identifying these groups using ethnic labels, particularly as we know that the majority of the Islamists who are fighting in northern Mali are not Malians,"" she told Al Jazeera. 
 In recent years they have been involved in drug trafficking and abductions of foreigners, she said. 
 Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb was originally an Algerian-based movement that migrated south in the Sahel region. The MUJAO, along with similar groups like Ansar Dine, have been enforcing strict Islamic law in northern Mali. 
 Rebels advance 
 In separate news, MUJAO seized another town, moving closer to government-held territory and signalling possibly expanding ambitions. 
 A convoy of lorries carrying men entered the town of Douentza early on Saturday morning and disarmed the local militia, witnesses and a spokesperson said. 
 ""We never retreat. Even if we don't advance any further, we will not go backward."" 
 - Oumar Ould Hamaha, Islamist leader 
 Douentza is located about 800km northeast of the capital, Bamako, but is near the de facto border with Malian military-held territory that currently divides half of the country from the other. 
 The group's leader, Oumar Ould Hamaha, told the AP news agency by telephone that the MUJAO had seized Douentza after a brief standoff with the local self-defence militia. Witnesses said there were no casualties. 
 The Malian military lost control of the northern half of the country, including the town of Douentza, in April following a coup by a small group of soldiers who managed to overthrow the country's civilian government a month before elections were to be held. 
 Giuffrida told Al Jazeera that the MUJAO is actively recruiting impoverished Malians in the north as fighters. 
 ""The less the Malian government makes its presence felt, the more the local population will feel that they might have no other option but to succumb to Islamists groups who are recruiting men who are quite desperate and jobless."" 
 MUJAO asserts authority 
 Until now, the MUJAO did not have a presence in Douentza, relying instead on an agreement with the local militia, which patrolled the area. 
 Hamaha said, however, that his group had ""closed their eyes'' to numerous things the militia was doing and had lost patience in recent days after it became clear that the militia was attempting to operate independently, insisting on keeping their own name. 
 ""I told my elements that we need to get rid of these people because they are refusing to respect us. We gave them the authorisation to come to this place, and now they want to work independently of us,'' Hamaha said on Saturday. 
 ""In the morning, when we encircled the town, we told them to turn in their arms. They resisted a little. They tried to make phone calls to ask for reinforcements, but when they saw that no one was coming to help them they laid down their arms in order to avoid a bloodbath. We tied them up and they are now with us."" 
 Moussa Ongoiba, a resident of Douentza, said that he counted at least 10 lorries carrying the Islamists. After patrolling the town the rebels took over a hotel at the entrance to Douentza, which now serves as their military base, he said. 
 After settling in, the Islamists, said another resident Oumar Samba, called a meeting with officials from the mayor's office and from the town's major civic organisations. The townsmen asked MUJAO to return the arms they had seized from the self-defence militia. 
 ""The mayor's office and civic leaders demanded that they return the arms taken from the militia,'' said Samba. ""But the Islamists did not accept. Many of the members of the militia have fled in order to leave Douentza. The rest that stayed behind have been detained by the Islamists.""

 ""I told my elements that we need to get rid of these people because they are refusing to respect us. We gave them the authorisation to come to this place, and now they want to work independently of us,'' Hamaha said on Saturday. 
 ""In the morning, when we encircled the town, we told them to turn in their arms. They resisted a little. They tried to make phone calls to ask for reinforcements, but when they saw that no one was coming to help them they laid down their arms in order to avoid a bloodbath. We tied them up and they are now with us."" 
 Moussa Ongoiba, a resident of Douentza, said that he counted at least 10 lorries carrying the Islamists. After patrolling the town the rebels took over a hotel at the entrance to Douentza, which now serves as their military base, he said. 
 After settling in, the Islamists, said another resident Oumar Samba, called a meeting with officials from the mayor's office and from the town's major civic organisations. The townsmen asked MUJAO to return the arms they had seized from the self-defence militia. 
 ""The mayor's office and civic leaders demanded that they return the arms taken from the militia,'' said Samba. ""But the Islamists did not accept. Many of the members of the militia have fled in order to leave Douentza. The rest that stayed behind have been detained by the Islamists.""

Many killed in Nigerian attacks,"At least 19 people have been killed after suspected Boko Haram gunmen carried out several attacks in the Nigerian cities of Gombe and Kano, authorities say. 
 Orubebe Ghandi Ebikeme, the local police commissioner in Gombe, said that the police headquarters in the provincial capital had been targetted by an attack late on Friday evening, after authorities had repelled an earlier attack on a prison. 
 At least 14 people died in the Gombe attacks, with at least five others wounded. 
 ""I have seen at least 14 burnt bodies in and around the police station,"" a witness in Gombe said, on condition of anonymity. 
 He said 10 of the bodies were inside the police building, while four others were inside the shell of a burned out car on a road between the police station and the prison. 
 The commissioner said there had been no arrests made and no one had immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. 
 Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden"", has targeted state offices and Christians in Gombe as part of increased attacks in its campaign to implement strict Sharia law in Nigeria. 
 Gombe was put under lockdown, with no residents allowed in public, after the gun and bomb assaults on the facilities. Witnesses said the gunmen were attempting to free the inmates at the prison, but failed to do so. 
 Residents said the police station had been completely burned to the ground, while the prison was intact. 
 Boko Haram has been responsible of a series of deadly attacks and assassinations across northern Nigeria in the past 17 months. 
 According to an Associated Press count, in 2012 alone, Boko Haram has been blamed for killing at least 310 people.

 He has repeatedly warned of a risk of al-Qaeda setting up a ""strategic zone"" for its network in Somalia, through its backing for al-Shabab. 
 Al-Shabab later confirmed that one of its ""holy warriors"" had carried out the attack. 
 ""One of our mujahidins went with his car laden with explosives to a building where the apostate and other members from his group had been meeting,"" Ali Mohamoud Rage, al-Shabab spokesman, said in Mogadishu.

 However, supporters of presidential claimant, Alassane Ouattara, said their protests would continue on Friday. 
 There were conflicting reports on the number of people killed on Thursday in the clashes between security forces and supporters of rival claimants to the presidency of the western African nation. 
 A government spokesman said at least 20 people were killed Abidjan in street protests against Laurent Gbagbo, recognised by the country's highest legal body as the winner of the November 28 presidential runoff. Ten of them were said to be demonstrators and 10 security forces. 
 Supporters of Ouattara had planned a march on the headquarters of state television held by Gbagbo, but fighting broke out when they were faced with heavily-armed security forces. 
 Soldiers loyal to Gbagbo clashed with supporters of Ouattara, who was declared president-elect by the country's election commission. 
 Al Jazeera's Yvonne Ndege, reporting from Abidjan, said the situation had calmed considerably late on Thursday. 
 ""At least four people were killed in Abobo, which is very near the state TV offices, but the opposition is saying 12 of their supporters have died."" 
 Our correspondent said it would be almost impossible for Ouattara's supporters to take control of state buildings and offices because Gbagbo, who was president for 10 years, still controlled the police and the military. 
 ""They [security forces] are loyal to him [Gbagbo] and believe adamantly that he won the election and that the official results showing Ouattara's victory were fraudulent ... so in their eyes they are simply defending the constitution and keeping law and order."" 
 Human rights group Amnesty International citing witnesses said at least nine unarmed people were killed in Abidjan during the protests. 
 Hours of violence 
 The US state department said its embassy in Cote d'Ivoire was hit by an errant rocket-propelled grenade during the protests. 
 ""It does appear that an errant RPG did strike the outer perimeter of the embassy with only slight damage and no injuries,"" Mark Toner, a department spokesman, said. 
 Earlier reports indicated that heavy weapons were fired near Ouattara's base at the Gulf Hotel, as security forces on pick-up trucks with mounted machine-guns blocked roads leading to the area. The hotel was guarded by UN peacekeepers. 
 Farhan Haq, a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said in a statement the UN has sent almost 800 military and police personnel and eight armoured personnel carriers to provide security at the Gulf Hotel. 
 Haq said on Thursday he had established contact with both sides with the aim of stopping the fighting in Abidjan. 
 Thursday's clashes came after Ouattara called on his supporters to take over state buildings, prompting security forces to mass along several streets in Abidjan firing tear-gas shells and stun grenades at stone-throwing protesters. 
 There were also reports that the military forced some protesters to strip and lie naked on the street in a bid to dissuade people from joining the protests. Businesses were closed, and residents had mainly stayed home. 
 Police and soldiers surrounded state TV offices, sealing off streets and blocking them with makeshift roadblocks constructed out of wooden tables and benches. Two armoured personnel carriers filled with helmeted troops were also parked nearby the television centre offices. 
 Mounting tensions 
 Tensions have been mounting in the world's top cocoa grower since the runoff poll which was intended to heal a north-south divide created by a civil war in 2002-03. 
 Instead, shortly after Ouattara was declared the winner by the country's electoral commission, the constitutional council overturned the result by invalidating half a million votes from Ouattara strongholds.

Somali comic who mocked al-Shabab shot dead,"Gunmen have assassinated a well-known comedian and musician who poked fun at al-Shabab fighters in the Somali capital, police and colleagues have said, the latest in a string of attacks against media and cultural figures. 
 Warsame Shire Awale, a famous composer who had worked with Somalia's national army band before joining Radio Kulmiye as a drama producer and comedian, was attacked by two armed men in Mogadishu, the capital, late on Monday. 
 ""Gunmen killed him ... we are investigating the matter and the killers will be brought to justice,"" police chief Ahmed Hassan Malin told journalists. 
 ""Two men armed with pistols shot and wounded him near his house in Waberi district, he died shortly after in hospital,"" said Abdi Mohamed Haji, a colleague at Radio Kulmiye. 
 Ali Mohamed Hussein, a senior al-Shabab official, said denied the group were responsible for the death, blaming instead government forces whom he said ""kill people for their telephones and their petty belongings"". 
 ""This gentleman was an old man and we had no wish to kill him,"" Hussein said. ""Blaming al-Shabab for this is a politically motivated issue."" 
 Islamic law 
 The killing, the latest in a wave of attacks on media workers in Somalia, follows the murder of fellow comic Abdi Jeylani Malaq Marshale in August, who also worked at Kulmiye. 
 Especially popular with young people, 61-year old Awale's programmes mocked the al-Shabab leadership, pointing out their misuse of the form of Islamic law they imposed in the war-torn Horn of Africa country.

 Warsame Shire Awale, a famous composer who had worked with Somalia's national army band before joining Radio Kulmiye as a drama producer and comedian, was attacked by two armed men in Mogadishu, the capital, late on Monday. 
 ""Gunmen killed him ... we are investigating the matter and the killers will be brought to justice,"" police chief Ahmed Hassan Malin told journalists.

 The killing, the latest in a wave of attacks on media workers in Somalia, follows the murder of fellow comic Abdi Jeylani Malaq Marshale in August, who also worked at Kulmiye.

Somali fighters in deadly cross-border raid,"Somalia's Islamist al-Shabab group have killed at least six Kenyans in a cross-border raid, claiming revenge for Nairobi's troop deployment against the al-Qaeda-linked group, police and fighters said. 
 Four police officers, a local government official and a civilian were killed in the attack by assailants, using firearms and an explosive device, said regional police chief Leo Nyongesa. 
 The fighters also kidnapped three people believed to be local government officials, and wounded another two policemen in the attack in Kenya's northeast, about 10km from the Somali border, he said. 
 The area has been hit by a series of blasts in the three months since Nairobi sent troops into Somalia to fight al-Shabab. 
 ""Six people have been killed, and three others were abducted,"" in the attack on Wednesday in Gerille in Kenya's Wajir district, said Nyongesa. 
 Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, which they said was carried out in revenge for ""the aggressive Kenyan invasion against the Muslims of Somalia"". 
 ""Seven Kenyan administration police and government officials were immediately killed, while others were taken prisoners,"" al-Shabab said in a statement, adding they also seized vehicles, communication equipment and weapons. 
 Kenyan officials have blamed the group and their sympathisers for a string of recent bombings and shootings, although armed bandits also operate in border areas. 
 Kenyans criticised 
 Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned that Kenyan security forces have been abusing civilians and Somali refugees in the northeastern regions following the spate of attacks since Nairobi sent troops into Somali in October. 
 Hand grenades have been thrown into bars and a church, while homemade explosive devices have been set off apparently targeting security forces. 
 ""In response, members of the security forces have been responsible for rape, beatings, looting, and arbitrary arrests of civilians,"" the New York-based rights group said in a statement on Thursday. 
 ""The crackdown has largely targeted Somali refugees and Kenyan ethnic Somalis, but residents of other ethnic backgrounds in North Eastern province have also been victimized."" 
 The most recent incident, HRW said, was the rounding up and beating on January 11 of residents of Garissa, the capital of North Eastern Province, in a local military camp. 
 ""When military officers can beat civilians in broad daylight without fearing repercussions, it's clear that impunity has become the norm,"" said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at HRW. 
 ""Repeated promises by both the police and the military to stop these abuses and investigate have amounted to nothing."" Kenyan army spokesman Major Emmanuel Chirchir told HRW he did not have knowledge of any abuses, but that the military would investigate the claims. 
 Victims told HRW they were told to roll around on the ground then kicked and beaten with the butts of guns simply because they were going about their business in the vicinity of the military camp.Regional armies 
 Armed groups have recently also targeted Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, about 100 km south of Wednesday's attack, which houses about 460,000 Somalis who have fled famine and war over the past two decades. 
 Gunmen seized two Spaniards working for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) from Dadaab in October and are thought to have taken them to Somalia. 
 The kidnapping of the Spaniards was one of the incidents that spurred Kenya to send troops to fight al-Shabab.

Hotels targeted in deadly Kenya attack,"At least 48 people have been killed after suspected al-Shabab armed fighters attacked Mpeketoni, a coastal town in Kenya's Lamu county, and set fire to three hotels and a police station, reports say. 
 The area is in the heart of the East African country's tourism industry. 
 The attackers targeted several buildings on Sunday, including hotels, a bank and a police station, David Kimaiyo, head of Kenyan police forces, was quoted by AP news agency as saying.

 Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre said on Twitter that it suspected the Somalia-based armed group al-Shabab, which has been blamed for previous violence in Kenya, of being behind the latest attack. 
 Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, reporting from Nairobi on Sunday, said the attack did not target foreigners in Kenya. 
 ""Attacks frequently carried out by al-Shabab target foreigners, but the latest one targeted locals in a small town,"" she said.

Deaths in al-Shabab attack on AU Somali base,"Somalia's al-Shabab fighters have killed three African Union soldiers and a civilian after staging an attack on the force's heavily fortified headquarters in the capital Mogadishu. 
 The AU force, known as AMISOM, said troops regained control of the base in Mogadishu after Thursday's attack that left five of the assailants dead while three others were captured. 
 ""Three AMISOM soldiers and a civilian contractor unfortunately lost their lives,"" AMISOM said in a statement, updating earlier information that said the four had been injured in the Christmas Day attack. 
 The statement did not mention the nationalities of the victims, but a contingent of Ugandan soldiers is in charge of the base. Burundi, Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti have also contributed troops to the mission. 
 AMISOM said some of the attackers were wearing Somali national army uniforms when they ""breached the base camp around lunch hour and attempted to gain access to critical infrastructure"". 
 ""AMISOM has regained control of the Halane base camp and restored normalcy,"" the statement added. 
 Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack almost as soon as the first shots rang out. 
 ""Our fighters are inside the headquarters of the foreign troops in Somalia,"" Abdulaziz Abu Musab, the spokesman, told the AFP news agency earlier on Thursday, adding that several AU soldiers had been killed. 
 Maman S Sidikou, head of AMISOM, told Al Jazeera that the force would act ""very quickly to the new tactics"" being used by al-Shabab and take the measures required to prevent any such events happening again. 
 A Western security source said between 15 and 20 attackers were involved in the assault. 
 Paddy Ankunda, the Ugandan spokesman for AMISOM, told AFP the assailants ""sneaked into the base camp near the airport... but our troops foiled the attack"".

Uganda politician's arrest sparks deadly riot,"At least two people have been killed after Ugandan police fired live bullets and tear gas to disperse crowds protesting against the arrest of Kizza Besigye, leader of the country's main opposition party, a Reuters witness says. 
 Ugandan security officials prevented Besigye from boarding a plane to Kenya on Friday to seek treatment for injuries received during his arrest on Thursday.   ""Plain clothes men have blocked him from leaving. We don't know why. They are threatening him with arrest if he does not leave (the airport),"" Anne Mugisha, deputy foreign secretary of the the Forum for Democratic Change party (FDC), said.   She said the plane Besigye had been due to board left for Nairobi without him. 
 One of the victims in Friday's riot appeared to have been shot in the head and was lying in a pool of blood at a local market, a witness said.   Michael Nataka, from the Ugandan Red Cross, said more than 100 people had sought medical attention.   ""There are a number of injuries. Some, about 21 of them, have bullet wounds. Then we have people who have been affected by tear gas, there are those who have injuries as a result of stones, they were hit by stones,"" he said. 
 ""Then we have those who look like they were beaten, either by batons or sticks. Then we have those who were injured as a result of falling down as they were running."" Nataka said. 
 Local media reported a third person had been killed in the riot, but the claims could not be independently verified. 
 Smoke billowed over the capital Kampala after crowds burnt tyres to block roads.   Protesters stoned shops and cars to express their anger at Besigye being beaten, pepper-sprayed and dragged away by police, all shown on TV.   Besigye, who was a runner-up to veteran president Yoweri Museveni in a disputed February election, was arrested and later freed on bail for his role in leading the ongoing protests against soaring fuel and food prices.   The protests - dubbed ""walk to work"" in solidarity with Kampala residents who cannot afford public transport as a result of high fuel prices - have been joined by several opposition politicians, one of them still in detention.

"South Sudan: Rebels, govt troops fight  in Juba","South Sudanese officials on Friday said clashes have broken out near Juba, the capital  between government troops and rebels, with several people killed. 
 It was  the latest violation of a ceasefire signed in December in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa between the government of President Salva Kiir and a myriad of opposition groups. 
 The truce was aimed at ending a four-year-old war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed. 
 Several violations have since taken place, for which all sides have been blamed. 
 On Friday, the armys spokesman Lul Koang said several people were killed after rebel troops attempted to seize a military outpost west of Juba held by Kiirs Sudan Peoples Liberation Army. 
 At about 10.30 p.m. last night, bandits under the direct command of Lieutenant Colonel Chan Garang attacked the SPLAs position at the north of Kapur, he told a news conference, referring to a high-ranking officer who defected from the government in 2017. 
 Koang did not give details on how many had died, but said fighting was going on. 
 Rebels under former vice president Riek Machar, whose sacking in mid-2013 amid a power struggle triggered the civil war months later, denied the charges. 
 That was not us, we never attack Juba, said Lam Paul Gabriel, the groups deputy spokesperson. It is government propaganda (meant) to accuse us of violations.

 It was  the latest violation of a ceasefire signed in December in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa between the government of President Salva Kiir and a myriad of opposition groups. 
 The truce was aimed at ending a four-year-old war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed. 
 Several violations have since taken place, for which all sides have been blamed. 
 On Friday, the armys spokesman Lul Koang said several people were killed after rebel troops attempted to seize a military outpost west of Juba held by Kiirs Sudan Peoples Liberation Army. 
 At about 10.30 p.m. last night, bandits under the direct command of Lieutenant Colonel Chan Garang attacked the SPLAs position at the north of Kapur, he told a news conference, referring to a high-ranking officer who defected from the government in 2017. 
 Koang did not give details on how many had died, but said fighting was going on. 
 Rebels under former vice president Riek Machar, whose sacking in mid-2013 amid a power struggle triggered the civil war months later, denied the charges. 
 That was not us, we never attack Juba, said Lam Paul Gabriel, the groups deputy spokesperson. It is government propaganda (meant) to accuse us of violations.

Uganda anti-gay bill back in parliament,"A bill that would make the death sentence mandatory for gays who are ""repeat offenders"" has been reintroduced in Uganda's parliament. 
 ""The anti-homosexuality bill was re-tabled on the floor of the House today and has been referred to parliament's legal and parliamentary affairs committee for scrutiny,"" Helen Kawesa, the parliamentary spokesperson, said on Tuesday. ""The committee is expected to examine it and conduct public hearings and then it will report back to the house for a formal debate on the bill,"" she said. 
 A small but vocal anti-gay movement, led by several MPs and a group of bishops, said it was determined to reintroduce the proposed legislation. The bill was originally proposed as a private member's bill in 2009 by David Bahati, a legislator with the ruling National Resistance Movement party, provoking an international outcry. It brings in the death penalty for anyone caught engaging in homosexual acts for the second time as well as for gay sex where one partner is a minor or has HIV.It also proposes to criminalise public discussion of homosexuality and would penalise an individual who knowingly rents property to a homosexual.Barack Obama, the US president, denounced the bill as ""odious"", and Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, called on Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to reject it and some international donors threatened to cut aid if it became law. The bill was shelved last May. The cabinet took it over and, after widespread international condemnation, said in August it had decided to drop the bill because existing laws were sufficient to deal with homosexual crimes. 'Homophobia capital'Homosexuality is taboo in many African nations. It is illegal in 37 countries on the continent, including Uganda, and activists say few Africans are openly gay, fearing imprisonment, violence and loss of jobs. The bill has given Uganda a reputation as the ""world's homophobia capital"". Ghana and Tanzania have said they will resist pressure to legalise homosexuality after Britain threatened to cut aid to countries that deny gay rights. ""We've always said it's not over until it's over. It's disappointing that this bill has been revived,"" Julian Pepe, a Ugandan gay rights activist, said. ""We're expecting a backlash from the public but we're not giving up our fight.

S Africa charges Nigerian suspect,"South African prosecutors have brought terrorism charges against Henry Okah, the leader of an armed Nigerian group, for deadly bomb blasts in the Nigerian capital.Prosecutors at a court in Johannesburg on Monday charged Okah, who lives in South Africa, with conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and the detonation of explosive devices in Abuja. 
 ""The accused is linked to the bombing that took place in Abuja,"" Hein Louw, the magistrate overseeing the court proceeding, said.Two car bombs exploded near a parade in Abuja marking Nigeria's 50th anniversary of independence on Friday, killing at least 10 people and injuring 36, according to police.The attacks were claimed by Nigeria's main militant group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (Mend). Security experts believe Okah - who accepted a government amnesty last year after gun-running and treason charges against him were dropped - was at one time the brains behind Mend, although he has denied ever being its leader.

 ""They all have direct links with Henry Okah, the incident and some unscrupulous prominent elements in society,"" Marilyn Ogar, the Nigerian State Security Service (SSS) spokeswoman told a news conference in Abuja.She said the SSS had foiled a larger plot to detonate at least six car bombs in the ""three-arm zone"" made up of the presidential villa, parliament and the supreme court just days before last Friday's attacks.""The despicable act of terrorism which eventually took place on October 1 was planned for Wednesday September 29 but was foiled as soon as information was received during the early hours of September28,"" Ogar said.""The over-riding objective of the group was to scare foreign visitors from attending the 50th anniversary celebrations.""'Unpatriotic elements' 
 A Mend statement signed by Jomo Gbomo - the pseudonym used by the group to claim previous attacks on Nigeria's oil industry - was emailed to media warning the area should be evacuated an hour before the Abuja bombs went off.But Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria's president, said investigations had revealed Mend members knew nothing about the attacks and they had been carried out by a small group based outside Nigeria, sponsored by ""unpatriotic elements within the country"".Timi Alaibe, Jonathan's special adviser on the Niger Delta, was quoted on Sunday as saying Mend's leaders were co-operating with the government.

ICC names Kenya violence suspects,"The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecution office has named six Kenyans, including the deputy prime minister and finance minister, for allegedly masterminding the country's worst post-independence bloodletting that claimed at least 1,200 lives.Uhuru Kenyatta, the finance minister, and William Ruto, a former minister, had been widely suspected of involvement in the violence before The Hague-based ICC named them, according to Kenyan media.Ruto had told Al Jazeera a day before the ICC announcement: ""I will defend myself against any unfair treatment"". 
 Announcing names of the suspects on Wednesday, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the chief ICC prosecutor, said that ""members of the government also committed crimes"". 
 ""We identified two individuals. The first is Francis Muthaura,"" Moreno-Ocampo said. 
 He said Muthaura was chairman of the National Security Advisory Committee and that he authorised police to use excessive force against civilians in Kisumu and Kibera, Kenya's sprawling slum area. 
 Al Jazeera's Mohammed Adow, reporting from Nairobi, said Luis Moreno-Ocampo's move has ""polarised opinion"" in Kenya. 
 ""There are those who support him for bringing justice to victims of post-election unrest, however, there are others who say he is playing politics,"" he said. 
 ""This move is expected to have huge ramifications on Kenya's political platform.""'Shooting and killing' 
 ""They were shooting and killing people [that] they didn't identify as supporters of the [opposition] Orange Democratic Party,"" said Moreno-Ocampo. 
 ""The second tactic was to make an arrangement with Mungiki [a group said to be allied with Kenya's largest and most powerful Kikuyu tribe] and let them attack civilians.""He said the attacks were ""facilitated by Kenyatta, who was the focal point between the Mungiki and the Party of National Unity (PNU)"".Kenyatta is a son of Kenya's independence leader, Jomo Kenyatta, and one of Kenya's most influential political figures.Moreno-Ocampo said: ""Mr Kenyatta's role was to facilitate the activities of Mungiki and Muthaura and to let them commit the crimes.""The prosecutor said the suspects ""were still innocent"" and that the ICC was still presenting the evidence before the judge decides.A Kenyan journalist, Joshua Arap Sango, was also named among the key suspects ""and he was involved in the planning of this operation,"" Moreno-Ocampo said.

 ""He says that if they do not voluntarily come to The Hague to appear before the court, he will then issue arrest warrants."" 
 Although Kenya has repeatedly assured the ICC prosecutor of its co-operation, Wednesday's announcement appears to have rattled the political class. 
 In a knee-jerk reaction, the government announced it was launching a local investigation.

Amnesty cites rights abuses in northern Mali,"Amnesty International has accused armed Tuaregs and groups fighting to impose Sharia law in northern Mali of carrying out grave rights abuses such as rape, murder and using child soldiers. 
 A report released on Wednesday by the London-based rights group said government soldiers had also carried out extrajudicial killings, branding the crisis Mali's worst human rights situation in 50 years. 
  
  
 Tuaregs fighting for the separatist Azawad Liberation Movement (MNLA) and other groups have seized control of much of the north of the country since a military coup in Bamako in March. 
 ""After two decades of relative stability and peace, Mali is now facing its worst crisis since independence in 1960,"" said Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's West Africa researcher. 
 ""The entire north of the country has been taken over by armed groups who are running riot. Ten of thousands of people have fled the region, creating a humanitarian crisis in Mali and in neighbouring countries.""The Amnesty researchers collected testimony from women and girls who said they were ""raped, sometimes collectively, by armed men including by members of the MNLA, particularly in Menaka and Gao"". 
 ""Delegates found evidence of the presence of child soldiers within the ranks of the armed Tuareg and Islamists groups who took control of the north of the country."" 
 'Extra-judicial executions' 
 The report states that soldiers too, were guilty of human rights violations. 
 ""Malian soldiers beat and then extra-judicially executed three unarmed people accused of spying for the MNLA in Sevare [630km north of Bamako] on 18 April 2012,"" read a statement from Amnesty. 
 The armed groups have also tortured and abused captured soldiers, slitting their throats, according to testimony from other soldiers who were taken prisoner and later released. 
 One group, Ansar al-Din, which has set about imposing Sharia law in the towns under its control, including the fabled Timbuktu, is using intimidation, violence and arbitrary killings to do so, according to Amnesty. 
 Mootoo warned that without efforts to protect human rights ""the entire sub-region risks destabilisation through the effects of political instability, armed conflict in the north and the food crisis which affects the whole of the Sahel.""

Kenya leader's ICC trial halted indefinitely,"The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has asked judges to indefinitely postpone the start of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's crimes against humanity trial, saying Nairobi was refusing to co-operate. 
 ""The prosecution respectfully submits that the appropriate course of action is to further adjourn the case until such time the government of Kenya executes the [prosecution's] revised request in full,"" prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in papers filed before the Hague-based court on Friday. 
 The trial of the Kenyan leader on five counts related to post-election violence dating back to 2007-2008 has been dogged by repeated delays. 
 Most recently, judges in March postponed its start until October 7 in order to give Nairobi a chance to look for financial documents, in an apparent final push by prosecutors to form a case against the powerful African leader. 
 Prosecutors hope the documents - among them company records, bank statements, records of land transfers, tax returns, phone records and foreign exchange records - will prove a link between Kenyatta and the deadly unrest in 2007-08 in which 1,200 died and 600,000 others were displaced. 
 Severe blow 
 The collapse of the case is a severe blow for the Hague-based court, the first permanent war crimes tribunal, which was set up with the aim of ensuring that people accused of the most serious international crimes face justice. 
 ""The accused person in this case is the head of a government that has so far failed fully to comply with its obligations to the Court,"" the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a filing, asking judges to adjourn the case indefinitely. 
 But Bensouda stressed that prosecutors were not dropping the five counts against him, ranging from murder and rape to deportation and persecution following the vote in Kenya, saying that would be ""inappropriate"". 
 In Naivasha, just north of Nairobi, where some of the worst violence occurred, victims of the violence said the collapse of the case was a dark day. 
 ""All our hope in getting justice after the 2007/08 chaos lay with the ICC but this has been crushed,"" said Esther Auma, a worker at a flower farm who said she lost her elder brother during the violence. 
 Kenyatta, the son of his country's founder, was elected president in 2012. He immediately began rallying Kenya's African Union allies in a diplomatic push to have the charges against him dropped, along with those against his deputy, William Ruto, who is already on trial on separate but similar charges. 
 The case against Kenyatta struggled in the courtroom, with prosecutors saying star witnesses had been intimidated into withdrawing their testimony against the president. Kenyatta's lawyers rejected the allegations.

 ""The prosecution respectfully submits that the appropriate course of action is to further adjourn the case until such time the government of Kenya executes the [prosecution's] revised request in full,"" prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in papers filed before the Hague-based court on Friday. 
 The trial of the Kenyan leader on five counts related to post-election violence dating back to 2007-2008 has been dogged by repeated delays. 
 Most recently, judges in March postponed its start until October 7 in order to give Nairobi a chance to look for financial documents, in an apparent final push by prosecutors to form a case against the powerful African leader. 
 Prosecutors hope the documents - among them company records, bank statements, records of land transfers, tax returns, phone records and foreign exchange records - will prove a link between Kenyatta and the deadly unrest in 2007-08 in which 1,200 died and 600,000 others were displaced. 
 Severe blow 
 The collapse of the case is a severe blow for the Hague-based court, the first permanent war crimes tribunal, which was set up with the aim of ensuring that people accused of the most serious international crimes face justice. 
 ""The accused person in this case is the head of a government that has so far failed fully to comply with its obligations to the Court,"" the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a filing, asking judges to adjourn the case indefinitely. 
 But Bensouda stressed that prosecutors were not dropping the five counts against him, ranging from murder and rape to deportation and persecution following the vote in Kenya, saying that would be ""inappropriate"". 
 In Naivasha, just north of Nairobi, where some of the worst violence occurred, victims of the violence said the collapse of the case was a dark day. 
 ""All our hope in getting justice after the 2007/08 chaos lay with the ICC but this has been crushed,"" said Esther Auma, a worker at a flower farm who said she lost her elder brother during the violence.

Shell accused of lying over Nigeria oil spill clean-up,"Shell has been accused of making false claims about the extent of its oil spill clean-up operations in Nigeria and urged to take more action to help worst-hit communities. 
 Amnesty International and the Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) charged the oil major with failing to implement recommendations from a critical 2011 UN report. 
 Amnesty and the CEHRD's claims come in a new report, ""Clean It Up: Shell's False Claims about Oil Spill Response in the Niger Delta"". 
 The 38-page document said most of the recommendations of a UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report had not been implemented since its publication five years ago. 
 Thirteen out of 15 areas visited between July and September this year were still ""visibly polluted"" or contaminated, despite claims to the contrary by Shell and the government. 
 The inadequate clean up left thousands of people ""exposed to contaminated land, water and air, in some cases for years or even decades,"" said Amnesty researcher Mark Dummett. 
 The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) said it rejected the groups' claims. 
 The SPDC said it was ""committed to the implementation of the UNEP report"". 
 It had ""initiated action on all the recommendations addressed directly to it,"" it added. 
 ""We disagree with the assertions made with regard to implementation ... and would like to reiterate that we have consistently and publicly reported our actions in this regard as well as highlighted ongoing challenges of crude oil theft and illegal refining,"" the SPDC said. 
 Saro-Wiwa execution 
 The claims come a week before the 20th anniversary of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, who helped bring the extent of oil-related ecological damage in Nigeria to the world's attention. 
 Wiwa and eight community leaders from Nigeria's southern Ogoniland area were hanged on November 10, 1995 after being convicted at a secret trial of murdering four local chiefs. 
 Nigeria's then military government ignored pleas for clemency from world leaders. 
 Special vigils and protests outside Shell petrol stations are planned in the run-up to next week's anniversary, Amnesty said on Tuesday. 
 But campaigners said communities in the creeks and marshes of Nigeria's oil-producing southern delta region were facing the same problems Wiwa highlighted two decades ago. 
 ""Twenty years; nothing has been done,"" Fyneface Dumnamene Fyneface, a human rights and environmental activist from Port Harcourt, said in a statement. 
 ""Ogoniland is still polluted ... no clean-up has been done ... justice has not been achieved. Twenty years and what they fought for has not been addressed.

Is Kenya turning its back on democracy?,"Opposition politician and lawyer Miguna Miguna, who had been charged with treason for attending the symbolic swearing in of opposition leader Raila Odinga at the end of January, was kicked out of the country on Tuesday. 
 Government authorities put him on an international flight to Canada, claiming he had renounced his Kenyan citizenship years ago. 
 The authorities also suspended passports of 14 opposition leaders, effectively barring them from leaving the country. 
 At least one other opposition member has been arrested. 
 Kenya's government also shut down four of the country's TV stations for nearly a week for attempting to broadcast the swearing in ceremony. 
 Two of the stations were allowed to go back on air on Monday, days after a court ordered them reopened. 
 Miguna, who ran for governor in Kenya's contested 2017 elections, had been arrested after attending Odinga's mock inauguration last week. 
 The ceremony was supposed to protest Uhuru Kenyatta's win last year — the opposition says the original vote in August was rigged and then boycotted the repeat election arguing electoral reforms had not been made after the Supreme Court nullified the first round of elections. 
 Miguna had been in detention despite Kenya's High Court ordering his release. He had not been seen for five days before he was deported to Canada. Miguna, who's a member of the National Super Alliance coalition, also holds Canadian citizenship. 
 The President of Kenya's Supreme Court, David Maraga, issued a rare statement slamming the government for not complying with court orders. 
 ""Compliance with court orders is not an option for any individual or institution,"" the statement said, adding compliance was not a favor to the judiciary, but a crucial constitutional obligation. 
 Protest against unlawful deportation 
 Lawyers at the High Court in Nairobi took to the streets accusing authorities of breaking the law. 
 ""The government not only broke the law, but they also abused police power by incarcerating a citizen of this country. Purporting to deport him is very grave,"" said lawyer Kipkoech Bernard Ngetich, chairman of the Rift Valley Law society. ""If someone is a citizen by birth who has not renounced his citizenship there is no way he can be deported."" 
 Lawyer Brian Kinyua said the Kenyan government had worsened the political atmosphere by breaching the constitution. 
 ""They know they are actually breaching the constitution, that is what they are blatantly doing,"" he said, warning nobody was above the law, ""not even the president."" 
 At the High Court in Nairobi, Justice Luka Kimaru has summoned the director of criminal investigations and the inspector general of police to court to explain why they failed to bring Miguna to court on several occasions and then deported him to Canada. 
 James Orengo, a lawyer and a leader in the opposition said if the two security officials refuse to show up in court, they should be charged. 
 ""We need the judiciary to stand firm. In the years past, they were completely emasculated by the state,"" he said. ""One of the things we really want to insist on is that the judge should make an order that Miguna must be brought back to the country."" 
 Moving backwards 
 The clampdown on opposition figures is dangerous for democracy, says human rights activist and regional director for ARTICLE 19 Eastern Africa, Henry Maina. 
 ""The last treason charges were largely in the 1990s, just as the country was turning into a multi-party democracy. So knowing that we've had seven elections, and we seem to be going back to treason charges — that implies we are going back to the pre-1990 days where the executive was using state security to maintain itself in power and it had very little regard to human rights at all."" 
 Recent events are ""clear indications that Kenya may be moving backwards, perhaps more closer to an authoritarian system than closer to a democratic system,"" he added. 
 Opposition leader Odinga has not been arrested yet. ""Odinga has a fanatical following… big masses who would take to the streets if they heard their leader had been touched,"" lawyer Ngetich said. ""They would almost make the country ungovernable."" 
 He also stressed Odinga had not committed a crime. ""There was no offense of treason or related to treason that was committed by any person if you read the law very strictly."" 
 That view was echoed by Maina. ""Our constitution clearly provides for peaceful assembly and association, so to the extent that the people who assembled did not commit any violent act, then it is problematic to call their meeting illegal,"" he said.

 Elections on August 8, 2017 were expected to be a neck- and-neck affair between incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta and his rival Raila Odinga. 
 A week ahead of the hotly contested vote, Christopher Musando, IT department chief of Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), was found dead. He was one of the few people with key information about the election management system. IEBC servers were supposedly breached in the 2013 polls. 
 The violence many Kenyans had feared and anticipated erupted just a few hours after the election results, handing victory to the incumbent, started to trickle in. Dozens of people were killed, mostly in the opposition strongholds. Refusing to accept the outcome of the poll, Raila Odinga turned to the Supreme Court. 
 The election was free and fair, international observers said, despite opposition allegations of rigging and hacked servers. Former US Secretary of State John Kerry, who headed a group of election observers from the Carter Center, also endorsed the vote. 
 To no avail, however as on September 1, Kenya’s Supreme Court declared the vote neither ""transparent nor verifiable"" and nullified the August 8 presidential elections, in which the IEBC had declared President Uhuru Kenyatta the winner with more than 54 percent of vote. The court called for new elections within 60 days. 
 A disappointed Uhuru Kenyatta, who had already received hundreds of congratulatory messages, called the Supreme Court judges 'crooks.' The Chief Justice emerged an African hero for taking a firm decision to annul the results that were in favor of the incumbent president. 
 Kenyatta's rival Raila Odinga pulled out of the re-run of the presidential election scheduled for late October. Odinga said he wanted to allow for the electoral commission to make fundamental reforms that would deliver a ""credible election."" 
 The opposition boycott targeted giants in the telecommunications industry and companies that deal in dairy products, cooking fats and oils. Raila Odinga took the lead, publicly migrating from the Safaricom phone network, whose client he had been for the last ten years, to a new provider called airtel. 
 In November, Kenya’s Supreme Court upheld President Kenyatta's victory in the controversial October re-run, which he had won with 98 percent of the vote on a turnout of 39 percent. The court dismissed two petitions that argued the second poll had not been conducted according to law. 
 Kenya, where politics have been characterized by ethnic tensions since independence in 1963, is deeply split along an ethnic divide that has triggered a debate on splitting the country into two. It’s now up to the two political heavyweights, Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga, (flanked above by the Archbishop of Canterbury) to bring the country back to normalcy.

Ivorian refugees flee to Liberia,"Tens of thousands of refugees from Cote d’Ivoire have fled over the border into neighbouring Liberia amid rising tension following last month’s disputed presidential elections. 
 The fresh wave of Ivorian refugees comes on top of the 14,000 people who already registered with the UNHCR in eastern Liberia last week. 
 ""With their numbers growing, the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them,"" the UN agency said, adding that it was preparing for more than 30,000 refugees.The exodus came as ECOWAS, the West African regional bloc, made efforts to try to persuade Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbemt president, to step down from the presidency after losing the November 28 runoff vote.But the firebrand leader of Cote d’Ivoire's ""Young Patriot"" movement said on Wednesday that a military intervention, one of the options ECOWAS is said to be considering, would be ""suicide"" for the entire continent. 
 Charles Ble Goude was greeted by a cheering crowd of about 2,000 supporters when he arrived in Abidjan's district of Yopougon. 
 'Peaceful solution' 
 Shortly after his arrival, he said the government was seeking a peaceful solution to the current crisis. 
 ""Nobody wished for this to happen but this post electoral crisis which today blocks Ivory Coast is challenging Africa to try and find a political solution to this political crisis,"" Ble Goude said. 
 The runoff vote that pitted Gbagbo against his rival Alassane Ouattara was meant to reunite Cote d’Ivoire, the world's top cocoa grower, after the 2002-03 civil war. 
 However, a dispute over the results has provoked clashes that have killed more than 200 people. 
 Provisional election commission results showed Ouattara with an eight percentage-point victory but the figures were quickly overturned by the country's top court, run by a Gbagbo ally, over allegations of fraud. 
 West African leaders have threatened to remove Gbagbo by force if he refuses to go quietly, but are likely to rely on persuasion rather than arms to get their way. 
 ""The military road is the road to suicide for all Africa. We don't wish that. I hope that wisdom will win in all camps and that aside from the emotions we will be able to see the interests of all of Africa,"" Ble Goude said at the rally. 
 ""We want to find a solution for this crisis but as we've been saying since 2002 it's not a military solution. There's only the negotiations way. That's what we wish for.""Gbagbo has shown no sign of giving in to the international pressure and has accused former colonial power France of orchestrating an international plot alongside the United States to get him out. 
 The French government, which has a military base in the country, dismissed the allegations as groundless. 
 Evacuation plans 
 The US has started planning for the possible evacuation of its embassy in Cote d’Ivoire, the state department said. 
 Mark Toner, a spokesman, said a team of eight Pentagon officials is now in Abidjan to weigh the US options, including evacuating embassy personnel. 
 ""They are looking at contingencies,” he said, adding that in the event of widespread unrest, evacuations ""would be normal and prudent"". 
 He also repeated US calls for Gbagbo to step down and said he should control his supporters. In a related development, the Washington lobbyist hired by Gbagbo's government resigned abruptly on Wednesday. 
 Lanny Davis, in a letter obtained by The Associated Press new agency, cited the refusal ""to allow president Barack Obama's call to be put through to Mr. Gbagbo, despite my repeated objections to that decision"". 
 Davis said he has not been able to reach Gbagbo directly to offer him this advice, despite repeated requests. 
 'On the brink' 
 Youssoufou Bamba, the country's new UN ambassador appointed by Ouattara, said that Cote d'Ivoire is ""on the brink of genocide"". 
 Bamba made the remarks after presenting his credentials to Ban Ki-Moon, the UN secretary-general, on Wednesday, making him the first Ouattara government envoy to assume a diplomatic post since last month's poll. 
 ""The situation is very serious,"" Bamba, 60, told journalists after meeting with Ban in New York. 
 ""Houses have been marked according to your tribe. What will be next? Something should be done."" 
 A spokesman for Gbagbo said that the government would cut off diplomatic ties with countries that recognise ambassadors named by Ouattara. 
 ""The government would like to make it known that in the light of such decisions, it reserves the right to apply reciprocity in ending the missions of their ambassadors in Ivory Coast,"" the government's spokesman said in a statement on national television. 
 The EU has said that it will tighten sanctions next month against Gbagbo, expanding a list of his supporters to be targeted, diplomats said on Wednesday. 
 Representatives of the 27 EU governments meeting in Brussels agreed to impose additional measures and to expand the number of Gbagbo supporters targeted by travel restrictions and asset freezes from 19 to 61. 
 'No military action' 
 Efforts to settle the dispute in Cote d'Ivoire diplomatically continued on Wednesday, with Jorge Borges, the Cape Verde foreign affairs secretary, saying that the option of a military intervention by ECOWAS was off the table for the moment. 
 His statement came after the presidents of Benin, Sierra Leone and Cape Verde briefed Goodluck Jonathan, the Nigerian president and current ECOWAS chairman, on their talks with Gbagbo on Tuesday. 
 The presidential delegation had delivered an ultimatum to Gbagbo to step down as leader or face removal by force.

 The presidential delegation had delivered an ultimatum to Gbagbo to step down as leader or face removal by force.

Somali refugees flooding Kenyan camp,"Tens of thousands of Somalis have fled drought and civil war in their homeland in the past month, leading to overcrowding and occasional violent incidents in the world's largest refugee complex in neighbouring Kenya. 
 Since June 6, around 27,000 people have arrived at a collection of camps in the town of Dadaab, 100km from the border with Somalia, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
 The new residents have raised the camp's population to more than 370,000, and some have erected ramshackle ""illegal structures"" for housing, UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said. 
 A demonstration against the demolition of some of those structures turned violent on Thursday, leaving two refugees dead and around a dozen injured, he said. 
 Kenyan police sought to disperse a crowd that had gathered to protest the demolition of some homes built up around a food distribution point, prompting a riot, Edwards said, and police responded with tear gas and live ammunition. 
 Some refugees want out 
 The strain on Dadaab, which is comparable in size to European cities such as Nice and Florence, has led some refugees living there to petition to leave. 
 The UNHCR, lacking space, has not provided newcomers with plots to live on for three years, though Kenyan authorities have recently established a new site to respond to the overcrowding. 
 Sahara Abdi, a 35-year-old mother of six, told the Reuters news agency that she wants to transfer to the Kakuma camp, three days away. 
 ""We are having problems accessing food, medicine and shelter because many refugees are comign to Dadaab every day,"" she said. 
 In 2011, Dadaab has seen around 10,000 refugees from Somalia arrive every week, according to the United Nations. Last year, that number was anywhere from 6,000 to 8,000. At least 1,000 people arrive every day. 
 Somalia has been torn by war for two decades, though the conflict has escalated in the past six years, as the newly created Transitional Federal Government and Islamic Courts Union (ICU) competed for rule of the country. 
 Though the ICU was defeated, the weak federal government relies on outside financial and military support to maintain its tenuous hold on power, and militias - including al-Shabab, an Islamist group - hold many times more territory than the government.

"Shell shuts down Bonga, cuts Nigeria’s oil output","The exploration and production arm of Shell in Nigeria  Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo) has announced the shutdown of its flagship facility, the 225,000 barrels per day (bpd) Bonga oil field, for maintenance. 
 With this development, Nigerias oil production that ramped up to 2.1 million bpd has dipped to 1.875million bpd. 
 A statement by Shells spokesperson in Nigeria, Bamidele Odugbesan, said the shut down was for maintenance of the oil field. 
 He said: SNEPCo has commenced turnaround maintenance at Bonga, executing statutory activities that will ensure continuous optimum operations at the deepwater field which began producing in November 2005. Production from the field was shut down on March 4, 2017, and is expected to resume at the conclusion of the exercise next month. 
 This is the fourth turnaround maintenance since Bonga began production. 
 Managing Director SNEPCo, Bayo Ojulari, said: The exercise will help ensure sustained production and reduced unscheduled production deferments. For the Bonga team, this is another opportunity to excel, having won the Asset of the Year Award 2016 in the Shell Group, followed by runners-up in Norway and Malaysia. We are pleased that the award recognised the continuing collaboration towards optimum production with a focus on safety, cost and Nigerian content development which will be invaluable in the maintenance work. 
 The turnaround maintenance involves inspections, recertification, testing and repair of equipment as well as engineering upgrades with Nigerian companies and subsea professionals playing key roles. A major focus is the Bonga floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, which is at the heart of the oil fields operations. The FPSO has the capacity to produce 225,000 barrels of oil and 150 million standard cubic feet of gas per day, he stated. 
 Bonga is Nigerias first deepwater development in depths of more than 1,000 metres, and is located 120km offshore Nigeria. SNEPCo expanded the project with further drilling of wells in Bonga Phases 2 and 3 and through a subsea tie-back that unlocked the nearby Bonga North West field in August 2014. Bonga Phase 3 achieved first oil in October 2015. 
 Also, the shutdown will result in shortfall of revenue to the Federal Government as the royalties, taxes and levies accruable to the government would be shelved within the period of the maintenance. 
 SNEPCo operates Bonga in partnership with Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria (Deep Water) Limited; Total E&P Nigeria Limited; and Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited under a Production Sharing Contract with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).

CSOs raise alarm over alleged ceding of Nigerian coastal waterways,"A coalition of Civil Society Groups (CSOs) has called on the House of Representatives to probe alleged ceding of the patrol of Nigerian coastal waterways to a foreign security firm. 
 The coalition in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, said that as vigilant civil society groups, they were constrained to bring the urgent attention of the general public to the deal. 
 The statement, co-signed by Mr Samuel Adodo, National Coordinator Empowerment for Unemployed Youth Initiative, and heads of 11 other CSOs, said that such deal violated Nigerians sovereignty. 
 We have petitioned the National Assembly following a recent report in the newspapers that the security patrol of Nigerian coastal waterways was ceded to a foreign firm. 
 It behoves on us to point out the grave national security implication of ceding the patrol of our waterways to foreign nations and firms which is a gross violation of our status as a sovereign Nation. 
 Some stakeholders collaborating with foreign firms to throw the Nigerian Navy out of our water ways have orchestrated a proposal which will be presented to the Federal Executive Council to cede the constitutional powers of the Nigerian Navy to a foreign consortium in exchange for the delivery of 100 fast boats to the Nigerian Navy. 
  In other to recoup its investment back, the consortium will be technically dedicated to the maintenance of the vessels while acting in another capacity as a commercial partner to the Navy. 
 The purpose of all this is to steal and divert our crude oil through the back door to Global destination and to short change the nation, If the waterways are not effectively Policed by the Navy, then somebody must want that loophole to make gains. 
 He said that the clandestine moves contravened the provision of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 
 The CSOs urged the House to thoroughly investigate among others the procurement process, the award of the contract of 195 million dollars to a foreign firm and also look into the terms and contractual agreement of the contract. 
 Some other signatories to the statement are Mr Yomi David, Transparency Advocacy for Development Initiative and Malam Suleiman Musa, Independent Public Service Watch.

Governments falling down on ivory trade commitments,"Global wildlife conservationists are demanding that parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered species of Wild and Fauna Flora (CITES) comply with wildlife laws. 
 Authors of a recent released report on the Elephant Wildlife Trade Information System, Traffic, a global network fighting the ivory trade, told DW that governments were failing to submit annual reports about ivory stocks. 
 Tom Milliken, the Elephant and Rhino Program Leader for Traffic, said there had been an expansion of wildlife smuggling networks across Africa in which Chinese and Vietnamese nationals were working with corrupt local officials. 
 ""They are involved in syndicates and moving ivory across Africa and then to Asia."" he said. 
 He said that cooperation in law enforcement between the countries involved in smuggling the ivory and those where it originated could save elephants from extinction. 
 ""If the governments of China and Vietnam were to station wildlife trade investigators who would work with Africans, we would be able to dismantle the transnational syndicates that are driving the trade."" Milliken said. 
 These days it is rare to see ivory carvings openly on sale 
 The report assessed ivory stockpile reports which showed that twelve parties had managed to submit their inventories in 2014. However, one year later that number had fallen to three. 
 Countries reporting to CITES 
 In 2014, Ethiopia, Gabon, Germany, Japan, Malawi, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Slovakia, Thailand, Uganda and Zambia submitted reports that stated they held no ivory stockpiles. 
 Five more parties, Belgium, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, the European Union and Tanzania submitted reports indicating they had ivory stocks but provided no figures on the status of those inventories. 
 In 2015, DRC, Namibia and Zimbabwe submitted ivory stock reports with inventory figures. The same year, Germany and Zambia also provided information, which included privately owned stocks. 
 Over a two year period, these stocks accounted for nearly 459 tons of ivory under the control of 15 parties, private stocks included. 
 Ivory ornaments in storage in South Africa prior to an auction in 2008 
 In a reference to the expansion of smuggler networks, the report said some countries were being used as transit hubs or processing sites, while others had storage facilities for the ivory. 
 Brighton Kumchedwa, Malawi´s Director of Parks and Wildlife said African governments were failing to declare their ivory stockpiles mostly because they lacked the resources to compile proper inventories. 
 He said his own country was ""at an advantage because we don't have much in terms of our stockpile,"" but conceded that they were ""certain countries that have huge stockpiles so they have to do the inventory on each piece of ivory and this calls for more resources"". 
 Conservationists say the only way to eliminate the illegal ivory trade is to pass legislation which is then rigorously enforced. 
 Incineration of ivory can be viewed as gesture against poaching and the ivory trade 
 Dr Arnulf Kohncke, Program Manager Species Conservation at World Wildlife Foundation said that burning of ivory, as it is being advocated for by some NGOs, should only be carried out as symbolic gesture against the trade. It was not a suitable means for its elimination. 
 ""The steps we need against poaching are mostly law enforcement on the ground and the work to reduce demand in East and South East Asia"" Kohncke said. 
 More than 30,000 elephants are killed in Africa every year for their tusks which frequently end up in Chinese and Vietnamese markets. 
 CITES regulations do not allow global trade in ivory, though they do permit one-off sales of national stockpiles. 
 Kenya is one country that has destroyed its ivory stockpile. In April, the country burnt huge quantities of ivory to underline its commitment to ending the ivory trade. 
 CITES member states will discuss amendments to wildlife trade regulations in South Africa in September. 
  
 A century ago, 10 million elephants were roaming across Africa - today, there are an estimated 450,000 to 700,000 African elephants and between 35,000 and 40,000 wild Asian elephants. Since elephant numbers have dropped by 62 percent over the last decade, conservationists fear they could be almost extinct in the next 10 years. 
 Every day, around 100 African elephants are killed for their tusks, which end up being sold mainly on the Asian market. In the past five years, Chinese demand for ivory has gone up, which fueled poaching even more. In July, customs officials at Zurich airport seized 262 kilograms (578 pounds) of ivory chopped up and hidden in eight suitcases during a random search on three Chinese passengers. 
 Wildlife trafficking has been estimated to be the third biggest illegal business after drug and human trafficking. Illegal ivory boosts all kind of conflicts across the continent. For example, insurgent groups like Al-Shabab, the Lord's Resistance Army and Boko Haram buy weapons by handing in elephant tusks. A pound of ivory sells for about $1,000 (903 euros) on the Chinese black market. 
 Despite a ban on international ivory trade, elephants are still being targeted in large numbers. Organizations like SOS Elephants say it's crucial to teach local communities about why elephants are important for Africa's ecosystem and how they can make a living through ecotourism and coexisting farming techniques instead. 
 In addition to poaching, elephants are also struggling with dwindling habitat. Human populations have vastly increased since the turn of the century, meaning there's less space for elephants: Forests have been cleared and turned into land for crops or livestock. And some of the animals have been captured, trained and used for activities such as illegal logging. 
 At the end of July 2015, US President Barack Obama announced plans to effectively ban most ivory trade in the United States and to add new restrictions when it could be exported. The US is the second biggest market for ivory after China which has also pledged to clamp down on ivory trade on its domestic markets.

"Stop blaming government, work for peace — Okei-Odumakin","Civil Society activitist Joe Okei-Odumakin, has said there was the need for a joint effort at promoting economic prosperity through peace and security rather than blaming government. 
 The founder of Women Arise for Change Initiative, spoke at the 6th Summit of the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria (APBN) in Abuja on Tuesday.

 Odumakin said that it is only when there is peace and security that the economy could thrive and usher in prosperity. 
 She identified insurgency, militancy, kidnapping, armed robbery, activities of herdsmen, and assassinations as some of the serious threats to security and peace. 
 She called for a collective effort in support of the government in the fight against violence and insecurity. 
 She emphasised the need for the reduction of poverty through economic empowerment. 
 Civil Society Orgnaisations (CSOs), she said, served as the watchdog of the society in the interest of the public and not to seek the fall of governments. 
 We want a government that works. We should stop blaming government at all times. 
 We should support government in enhancing the atmosphere that can bring about economic development.

Reps to probe Police IG over Peace Corps," Coalition of Civil Society Organizations for Justice and Equity (Coalition-JE), has written a petition to the House of Representatives against the IG of Police, Ibrahim Idris, accusing him of disobeying court orders on Peace Corps.  
 The group petitioned the House over what it described as total disregard of court judgments by the Inspector-General of Police. 
 Rita Orji, member representing Ajeromi/Ifelodun federal constituency of Lagos State, read the petition signed by Comrade Olayemi Success on behalf of the coalition. 
 The petitioners said that the IGP has fragrantly disregarded various court judgments against him and the Police and in favour of the  Trustees of Peace Corps of Nigeria (PCN) and its National Commandant, Amb. Dickson Akoh. 
 The group prayed the house to summon the Police IGP and the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), to explain why subsisting court orders were flagrantly disobeyed by them. 
 We urge Mr Speaker to call the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Inspector-General of Police, the leadership of Peace Corps of Nigeria and Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development, to know what the problem is. 
 It is a strange act that smacks of mischief for the Attorney-General of the Federation who is the Chief Law Officer of Nigeria to advise the IGP to comply with judgments of court and he shows recalcitrance or reluctance to obey. 
 Recall that during public hearing on the Nigerian Peace Corps Bill, the Police strongly opposed to its passage. On the day the Corps commissioned its new corporate headquarters after the passage of the Bill by both chambers of the National Assembly, an event that was well attended by several legislators, the Police swooped on the office and sealed it up. 
 This is an affront on the integrity and sanctity of the nations parliament, which cannot happen in any civilised part of the world, the petition reads in part. 
 According to the petitioners, the Police had been sealing the offices of the Corps since 2010 and the corps had been suing the Police and wining the cases. 
 The group also tendered evidence of letters written by past Attorneys-General of the Federation on the 11th March 2010, 19th November 2010 and 30th January 2012, advising the Inspector-General of Police to obey court orders over the harassment and sealing of Peace Corps office. 
 We also have it on authority that the incumbent Attorney-General of the Federation also wrote to the IGP recently to obey the court judgments in favour of Peace Corps of Nigeria, but the IGP has refused to unseal the office, the group added. 
 The petitioners also said the press release of the Nigeria Police as published in page 31 of the Nigerian Tribune of 17th January, 2018 and page 40 of the Blueprint of 17th January, 2018, describing the PCN as proscribed organisation was misleading, as two separate court judgments by Justice Auta J and Justice Chukwu J in 2011 and 2013 respectively, already declared such action illegal and affirmed PCN as a lawful organisation.

 The petition was referred to the House Committee on Public Petitions. 
 Recall that Justice Gabriel Kolawole of the Federal High Court, on 9th November 2017, awarded a cost of N12.5m damage against the Nigeria Police, while ordering them to unseal the corporate headquarters of PCN forthwith. 
 Also, Justice John Tsoho of the Federal High Court on 15th January 2018, declared as illegal, the continuous sealing of the PCN office, thereby calling on the IGP to immediately unseal the property.",Coalition of Civil Society Organizations for Justice and Equity,Reps,,,"IG of Police, Ibrahim Idris",Peace Corps,,,," Coalition of Civil Society Organizations for Justice and Equity (Coalition-JE), has written a petition to the House of Representatives against the IG of Police, Ibrahim Idris, accusing him of disobeying court orders on Peace Corps."," Coalition of Civil Society Organizations for Justice and Equity (Coalition-JE), has written a petition to the House of Representatives against the IG of Police, Ibrahim Idris, accusing him of disobeying court orders on Peace Corps.  
 The group petitioned the House over what it described as total disregard of court judgments by the Inspector-General of Police. 
 Rita Orji, member representing Ajeromi/Ifelodun federal constituency of Lagos State, read the petition signed by Comrade Olayemi Success on behalf of the coalition. 
 The petitioners said that the IGP has fragrantly disregarded various court judgments against him and the Police and in favour of the  Trustees of Peace Corps of Nigeria (PCN) and its National Commandant, Amb. Dickson Akoh. 
 The group prayed the house to summon the Police IGP and the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), to explain why subsisting court orders were flagrantly disobeyed by them. 
 We urge Mr Speaker to call the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Inspector-General of Police, the leadership of Peace Corps of Nigeria and Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development, to know what the problem is. 
 It is a strange act that smacks of mischief for the Attorney-General of the Federation who is the Chief Law Officer of Nigeria to advise the IGP to comply with judgments of court and he shows recalcitrance or reluctance to obey. 
 Recall that during public hearing on the Nigerian Peace Corps Bill, the Police strongly opposed to its passage. On the day the Corps commissioned its new corporate headquarters after the passage of the Bill by both chambers of the National Assembly, an event that was well attended by several legislators, the Police swooped on the office and sealed it up. 
 This is an affront on the integrity and sanctity of the nations parliament, which cannot happen in any civilised part of the world, the petition reads in part. 
 According to the petitioners, the Police had been sealing the offices of the Corps since 2010 and the corps had been suing the Police and wining the cases. 
 The group also tendered evidence of letters written by past Attorneys-General of the Federation on the 11th March 2010, 19th November 2010 and 30th January 2012, advising the Inspector-General of Police to obey court orders over the harassment and sealing of Peace Corps office. 
 We also have it on authority that the incumbent Attorney-General of the Federation also wrote to the IGP recently to obey the court judgments in favour of Peace Corps of Nigeria, but the IGP has refused to unseal the office, the group added. 
 The petitioners also said the press release of the Nigeria Police as published in page 31 of the Nigerian Tribune of 17th January, 2018 and page 40 of the Blueprint of 17th January, 2018, describing the PCN as proscribed organisation was misleading, as two separate court judgments by Justice Auta J and Justice Chukwu J in 2011 and 2013 respectively, already declared such action illegal and affirmed PCN as a lawful organisation. 
 They prayed the House of Representatives to intervene in the matter and make the IGP to obey all standing judgments against the Force.

"Babangida congratulates Buhari, calls for healing of wounds, restructuring","Former military president of Nigeria, Gen.Ibrahim Babangida, has sent a message of congratulations to President Muhammadu Buhari on his reelection for a fresh term of four years. 
 In a long message that dredged some of the issues that triggered some disagreement between the two leaders last year, Babangida asked Buhari not only to heal wounds from the election, but also to restructure the country and introduce creative measures to tackle the economy. 
 The former military leader called restructuring agitators, reasonable Nigerians. 
 The President may wish to heed to the yearnings of reasonable Nigerians for restructuring and seek all constitutional means to devolve some powers presently exercised by the Federal Government to the other tiers of government, he said. 
 Babangida also asked Buhari to heal the wounds arising from the electioneering campaign and the outcome. 
 The newly elected president should heal the wounds of the heated campaign exchanges by embracing those who contested alongside with him. 
  The President must resist the temptation to see them as enemies; not even opponents, but fellow compatriots who merely disagreed with him on how best to move our country forward. 
 He also reserved special praises for Atiku Abubakar, Buharis main challenger, decorating him with several adjectives, such as being dogged, gallant, audacious and his electoral support cutting across ethnic ethnic, religious and regional lines. 
 However, Atikus winning votes across all lines of divide was not peculiar as Buhari even outperformed him, winning at least 25 per cent in 34 states and FCT and outrightly winning 19 of the 36 states. 
 Atiku led in the traditional PDP states of South South and South East but struggled to win his home state of Adamawa. He  also won narrowly in Ondo,  Oyo, Benue, Plateau, Taraba  states.  He  trailed Buhari in most of the  North West and North East states, and failed to make 25 per cent cut in Kano, Kebbi, Zamfara, Borno, Katsina, and Yobe.  He also lost to Buhari in Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kwara, Ekiti, Kogi, Gombe, Kaduna, Niger, Sokoto, Jigawa and Kaduna. 
 Babangidas full statement: 
 The 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections have come and gone. These elections have produced a new president elect and new elected members of the Senate and House of Representatives. 
 I congratulate the Nigerian electorate who conducted themselves peacefully during the voting process; they were enthusiastic to exercise their democratic rights of electing candidates of their choice. Sadly, due to violence in some part of the country, lives were lost and I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to their families for the death of their loved ones. 
 I wish to congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR on his re-election to lead Nigeria in the next four years. I have observed that, the electioneering campaign was very strenuous and the contest very keen. That despite the turbulent terrain of politics, the President submitted and subjected himself to this process. Indeed is a clear testimony that he believes in the democratic process and ideals. 
 The newly elected president should heal the wounds of the heated campaign exchanges by embracing those who contested alongside with him. The President must resist the temptation to see them as enemies; not even opponents, but fellow compatriots who merely disagreed with him on how best to move our country forward. 
 Now that the President has won his re-election bid, he should confront with renewed vigour the most urgent problem confronting Nigeria: insecurity of lives and property. The Boko Haram insurgency remains a threat to many Nigerians particularly in the North East sub region, while the twin evils of kidnapping and armed robbery/armed banditry remain a major national menace. The president must pay priority attention to these security issues. 
 The economy of the country must also occupy the presidents urgent attention. There is the need to be more creative in formulating policies that will improve the nations economy, create employment opportunities and give hope to our teaming youths. 
 The President may wish to heed to the yearnings of reasonable Nigerians for restructuring and seek all constitutional means to devolve some powers presently exercised by the Federal Government to the other tiers of government. 
 Let me commend and convey my admiration to the other contestants for the office of president. 
 I was particularly impressed with the gallant and audacious spirit of the main challenger in the presidential race, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar GCON. I was not surprised that even though he lost the most exotic position of the land, his doggedness and pattern of support cut across ethnic, religious and regional lines that earned him the second position of the last Presidential election. 
 I call on the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to close ranks and work with the winner of the election in an objective and constructive manner so that democracy will continue to thrive in our country at this crucial period of renaissance. 
 I urged him also to endeavour and prevail on his admirers to eschew bitterness and violence. They must be prevailed upon to understand that politics is a game in which there must be only one winner. 
 I pray that the Almighty Allah will continue to guide our democratic steps for peace and progress in our country.

Nigeria president meets unions over strikes,"Nigerian unions are meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan to try to defuse a dispute over the removal of fuel subsidies that has paralysed the economy and raised fears of a shutdown of its oil industry, officials have said. 
 Strikes and protests brought the country to a standstill last week and workers in the vital oil industry have threatened to halt production from Sunday. 
 Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets and staged strikes for five straight days in protest against the removal of a fuel subsidy on January 1, which more than doubled the pump price to $0.93 per litre. 
 The two main labour confederations, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC), held meetings of their executive councils in Abuja, the capital, on Saturday and decided to stick to their demand that petrol prices return to pre-January 1 levels. 
 ""We are continuing with the national strike until the prices are reverted to 65 naira ($0.40) per litre,"" Denja Yaqub, NLC assistant secretary general, told the AFP news agency. 
 ""If there's any negotiation at all to be done, the negotiation will only start when the price has gone back to 65 naira. 
 ""We are going to convey the same position to him [Jonathan] tonight."" A source from the TUC said it had decided on the same position. 
 Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi told the Reuters news agency on Thursday that the strikes were costing Africa's second biggest economy about $600m each day. 
 Strike on hold 
 Unions have suspended strike action for the weekend, pending the talks in which they and the government are expected to reach some kind of agreement. If they do not, general strikes will continue next week. 
 The oil workers' unions had said it will cut production in Africa's biggest exporter, starting from Sunday. 
 ""The government's expectation is that today's meeting will bring an end to the whole crisis so that the nation can move forward,"" a senior source at the presidential villa told Reuters. 
 The confrontation is a serious setback for Jonathan, already under fire for failing to quell violence instigated by the radical Islamist group Boko Haram in the north. 
 Most fuel price demonstrations have been peaceful, but at least three protesters have been shot dead by police. A police officer has been arrested for fatally shooting a man in Lagos.

Nigerian oil labour union suspends Exxon Mobil strike in Rivers state,"YENAGOA, Nigeria, May 20 (Reuters) - A Nigerian labour union that had called for the shutdown of all Exxon Mobil Corp facilities in the Niger Delta has suspended its strike at its Rivers state branch in the oil production hub, two union representatives said on Saturday. 
 Reuters had been unable to verify independently whether members of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) had shut the company’s facilities in the region on Friday, and oil industry sources said there was no impact on production. 
 “The strike has been suspended,” said Chika Onuegbu, who represents PENGASSAN in Rivers state. 
 Onuegbu and a senior PENGASSAN official, who also said the strike in Rivers state had been suspended but did not want to be identified, said the move followed a ruling by an industrial arbitration panel.

Rebels reject DR Congo peace plan,"Rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo say they will not lay down their arms until they have had direct talks with the country's government. 
 Despite being ordered by the leaders of DR Congo's neighbours on Saturday to release their hold over the key eastern city of Goma, the M23 group told Al Jazeera they were standing firm. 
 Regional leaders met in the Ugandan capital of Kampala and called on M23 to end hostilities and leave Goma, a key city in the eastern provice of North Kivu, after their advance in the east of DR Congo led to fears of a wider conflict. 
 The meeting of heads of state in the Great Lakes region went forward without one key player - Rwandan President Paul Kagame, whose country the UN accuses of backing the rebels - and wrapped up after less than an hour. 
 In their closing statement, the leaders called on the rebels to ""stop all war activities"" and ""stop talk of overthrowing an elected government"". 
 Al Jazeera's Peter Greste, reporting from the Kampala summit, said that some delegated described the agreement as a ""breakthrough"". 
 ""It is a two-fold agreement. The main point of it is that the Congolese government is to listen to M23 and address their grievences. The second part is that M23 is to withdraw from Goma and move back to positions 20km to the north of the city, with a neutral zone policed by the UN,"" he said. 
 Kagame, whose country denies backing the M23, had been expected to attend the meeting in Kampala. 
 Kagame was due to hold talks with his counterpart from the Republic of Congo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, later on Saturday, according to sources in both capitals. 
 Members of Sassou's delegation had already arrived in the Rwandan capital. 
 But a Ugandan foreign ministry official told AFP news agency shortly before the summit that Kagame was not coming and would instead be represented by his foreign minister, Louise Mushikiwabo. 
 No reason was provided for the absence. 
 Kabila flew in for the summit in Kampala, which also included the presidents of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. 
 A Ugandan official had earlier said that both Kagame and Kabila would attend, and that without them the summit would be ""meaningless"". 
 The international community has voiced alarm over the rapid advance by the M23 in a mineral-rich but underdeveloped region where the fighters seized Goma and another key town nearby in less than a week. 
 The advance of M23 has displaced tens of thousands of civilians, prompted warnings of a humanitarian disaster, and raised fears that a wider conflict could again erupt in the area, the cradle of back-to-back wars that shook DR Congo from 1996 to 2002. 
 The rebels captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, on Tuesday after less than a week of fighting, before taking Sake, 20km to the west, the next day. Reports on Saturday said the situation was calm but tense in both towns. 
 Refusal to withdraw 
 Kabila met the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda immediately following the fall of Goma and the three leaders issued a joint statement urging M23 to pull out of the city. 
 The M23 has refused to withdraw unless Kabila agrees to direct peace talks with the group. 
 The UN has also accused Uganda of backing the M23 rebels, charges that it, like Rwanda, denies. 
 In DR Congo's capital Kinshasa, the interior ministry temporarily banned peace protests on Saturday, blocking students from holding a planned rally. 
 The move came after several thousand women, including Wivine Mumba Matipa, justice minister, and several politicians, marched on Friday against the violence. 
 Protesters have staged demonstrations in several DR Congo cities since the rebels seized Goma, sometimes turning violent and throwing stones. 
 Three people died at a protest in Kisangani, the capital of the eastern province of Orientale, according to UN-sponsored broadcaster Radio Okapi. 
 The UN has come in for criticism at the rallies, where protesters have accused its peacekeepers of not doing enough to stop the rebels. 
 The M23 was launched by former fighters in an ethnic Tutsi rebel group that was integrated into the military under a 2009 peace deal whose terms the mutineers say were never fully implemented.

"No deal with Kabila, says Felix Tshisekedi","Congolese opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi rejected suggestions that he might do a deal with President Joseph Kabila, at a rally which passed off peacefully on Tuesday.

 The (party) elected me to be presidential candidate, so how can I be lowered to prime minister? Rather, let me be led to the final victory in the presidential election. 
 Kabilas opposition is weak and divided. Many opposition politicians joined a power-sharing government after the death of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, Felixs father, last year. 
 Dozens have died in protests, most shot dead by security forces, since Kabila refused to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate in December 2016. But Tuesdays rally was unusual in that it was permitted, watched closely by armed police. 
 Popular anger could easily boil over if elections are delayed again or are not perceived to be fair. In addition, several parts of the country are dealing with armed rebellions. 
 Donors have expressed concern about plans to use new electronic voting machines, saying the system is untested and could allow fraud. Congos government reacted by saying it would reject foreign aid for the poll.

 Popular anger could easily boil over if elections are delayed again or are not perceived to be fair. In addition, several parts of the country are dealing with armed rebellions. 
 Donors have expressed concern about plans to use new electronic voting machines, saying the system is untested and could allow fraud. Congos government reacted by saying it would reject foreign aid for the poll. 
 Their machine is a machine to cheat. The electoral register is corrupt and merits a serious audit, Tshisekedi said.

Kenya hopeful over new constitution," 
 The Kenyan president has signed into law a new constitution that intends to devolve power to the people. 
 Tens of thousands of residents gathered in Nairobi, the capital, as Mwai Kibaki signed the documents, which will give more authority to local governments and gaurantee Kenyans freedom of expression. 
 In a referendum earlier this month, nearly 70 per cent of Kenyan voters approved the constitution, which addresses major issues including corruption, political patronage, land grabbing and tribalism.

Confusion swirls over Kenya vote count,"Nairobi, Kenya - Polling station chiefs have been flown to Kenya's capital to speed up the announcement of the country's election results, but analysts are not expecting the nation's next president to be revealed for some time yet. 
 With fears of technical problems affecting the systems of the IEBC, Kenya's central elections commission, the shift to a manual count also aims to ward off further allegations of electoral irregularities. 
 Ahmed Issack Hassan, IEBC chief, has since revealed that results may not be available until Friday - or even Monday - a far cry from the 48 hours they had confidently predicted before votes were cast. 
 Though voting day passed off largely peacefully - albeit marred by isolated incidents, including the killings of more than a dozen people in Mombasa - electoral observers have said that violations of electoral procedure were noted across the country. 
 Kenya's Election Observers Group (ELOG) said that in 15.2 percent of polling places, people who were not registered on the electoral roll were nonetheless allowed to vote, and in 17.6 percent, voter secrecy was violated. 
 Ballot-box issues reported 
 Uchaguzi, a citizen monitoring group has also said that widespread ballot-box issues have been reported, with some citizens protesting what they perceive to be ""foreign votes"" introduced into the ballot boxes. 
 What has been causing most contention among campaign staff and observers has been the huge number of spoiled votes. More than 330,000 ballot papers - nearly six percent of all those so far counted - have been rejected. 
 ""Most of the rejected ballots I encountered were spoiled because voters put a tick in the box next to the candidate of their choice, and then put crosses in all the other candidates' boxes, [invalidating the papers]"" Joseph Khanda, presiding officer at a polling station in the Nairobi suburb of Westlands, told Al Jazeera. 
 ""Other voters put no mark at all on voting papers. A lot of people seemed to only want to vote in the presidential and member of national assembly ballots, and not to vote in the other polls."" 
 With the race between Prime Minister Raila Odinga  and his deputy, Uhuru Kenyatta , so close, tensions are rising and allegations are beginning to fly. 
 But should the rejected ballots be counted? 
 Expert's opinion 
 Bob Mkangu, a lawyer and member of the committee that drafted Kenya's constitution, says yes. 
 ""The Kenyan constitution states that, under article 138 subarticle four, that, in considering the proportion, in percentage, of how much each candidate gets in a presidential election, we have to consider that through examining all the votes that have been cast for that presidential election,"" he told Al Jazeera. 
 ""Meaning that, in calculating that percentage, you calculate regarding all the votes, whether rejected or valid. 
 ""To give an example, in a polling station, if a box is opened, what is counted is all the votes for each candidate - and the rejected votes are also considered. But in doing the percentage for how much each and every candidate has gotten, all those votes, including the rejected ones, are considered. And the philosophy behind that is the fact that each and every Kenyan who went to cast a vote and had an opinion about who he or she wanted to be president - that entire totality - should be considered… Both the valid and invalid votes should appear [in the final tally]. 
 ""The message to Kenyans from diverse voices is to remain calm and patient, considering also that the constitution does gives the electoral management body up to seven days to declare the final declaration."" 
 On this point, Kenyan law seems clear, with a clause in the country's new constitution stating ""votes cast"" count towards the total, rather than ""validated votes"". 
 Chapter seven, paragraph 86 of the Kenyan constitution states: 
 At every election, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission shall ensure that: 
 (a) whatever voting method is used, the system is simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent;(b) the votes cast are counted, tabulated and the results announced promptly by the presiding officer at each polling station;(c) the results from the polling stations are openly and accurately collated and promptly announced by the returning officer; and(d) appropriate structures and mechanisms to eliminate electoral malpractice are put in place, including the safekeeping of election materials. 
 Including the spoiled votes in the total number of votes cast lowers the proportion of the total vote that can be attributed to each candidate. With Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition taking an early lead in the count, the inclusion of spoiled votes brings his total back down closer to the 50 percent mark - and brings the country closer to a run-off vote between the two frontrunners in a month's time. 
 Kenyatta's running mate, William Ruto, has claimed that UK High Commissioner to Kenya Dr Christian Turner - an accredited election observer - was behind the IEBC's decision to include the spoiled votes in the statistics. 
 ""Further, we at the Jubilee Coalition are alarmed by the abnormally high influx of British military personnel in the country which began around the voting day, under the pretext of training,"" said Jubilee spokesperson Charity Ngilu. 
 The troops are on a routine exercise planned nine months ago, said British officials. 
 “Claims of British interference, including by the High Commission, in the electoral process are entirely false and misleading,"" read a statement from the UK foreign office. 
 ""The UK does not have a position on the question of how to handle the rejected votes. That is for the IEBC, and, if necessary, Kenyan courts, to determine."" 
 Odinga's ODM party have also said that the votes counted so far have been collated from Jubilee strongholds, and that Odinga heartlands have yet to be tallied. ODM officials have been collating their own tallies from election centres around the country, and maintain they are leading the vote count, despite the figures so far released by the IEBC. 
 Odinga ""knows he is winning"", a top campaign aide said late on Tuesday night. 
 The IEBC said that the vote continued through the night, despite few updates being published. 
 ""The electronic transmission system was slow, but the vote count did not stop,"" said the IEBC's Tabitha Muthemi. 
 Muthemi also denied that their software had been tampered with. 
 ""That is a rumour,"" she said. ""We think we have not been hacked."" 
 Patience needed 
 European Union observers said the elections had been characterised by a push for peace, transparency and credibility. 
 ""Great patience is now required,"" EU Chief Observer Alojz Peterle told reporters. 
 ""Quite many factors cause rejected votes,"" said Peterle, a former prime minister of Slovenia. ""It is up to election authorities to be clear with that. We need clarity, because this is an important element of the story."" 
 Peterle denied that the EU mission had urged the IEBC to include the spoiled papers in the overall count. 
 ""We are observers, not agents,"" he said. ""We are here as partners. Our mission is clear; we don't have a political mission here."" 
 Money well spent? 
 Since 2010, the US State Department has awarded $35m to the Kenyan government for voter education campaigns. 
 The EU has invested $5.6m in the electoral process, as part of a $25m package to boost governance and civil society programs in Kenya. 
 ""The civic education programmes did not work as well as we'd hoped,"" polling station chief Joseph Khanda admitted on polling day. 
 With so many votes cast erroneously, how was this money spent? 
 The IEBC held a series of public workshops in each county across Kenya during the month of February, covering a range of topics from ""making wise electoral choices"" to ""post-election peace and cohesion"", as well as explaining how the biometric voter recognition machines worked. 
 The elections body also held a competition to design posters highlighting peaceful electioneering as well as women's and youth participation. 
 A State Department official told Al Jazeera they would not comment on whether the US considered this to be money well spent.

Partial recount ordered in Kenyan poll,"Kenya's Supreme Court has ordered a partial recount of ballots from the country's March 4 presidential election, after losing candidate Raila Odinga alleged that voter fraud had taken place at some polling stations. 
 The court ruled that the presidential results at polling stations in 22 of the country's 291 constituencies be recounted, and forms indicating official results in all 33,400 polling stations be scrutinised for accuracy. 
 ""The re-tallying of the presidential votes in 22 polling stations will make this court establish whether the number of votes cast exceeded the number of registered voters,"" Justice Smokin Wanjala said on behalf of the six-judge bench. 
 The court said the recount should be concluded by Wednesday. 
 A swift and transparent resolution of the dispute that has unnerved the country's stock market is seen as critical to restoring the reputation of Kenya as a stable democracy, after violence following the 2007 election left more than 1,200 dead. 
 This year's voting passed peacefully and went a long way to restoring Kenya's image. International observers said voting on the day was broadly credible, but the count then went on for five days and monitors did not follow the entire process. 
 The recount was ordered by the Supreme Court on Monday. 
 Odinga has said there was ""rampant illegality"" in the first-round victory of his long-term rival Uhuru Kenyatta. 
 The son of Kenya's founding president, Kenyatta said the voting was ""free and fair"". 
 Adjudicating between the two political heavyweights is seen as a major test for the country's reformed judiciary. 
 Chief Justice Willy Mutunga has repeatedly said the Supreme Court would handle the dispute fairly. 
 ""We shall render our judgment without fear or favour of anyone or anything, devoid of ill-will towards any persons or affection towards any cause that is partisan, unconstitutional, or illegal,"" Mutunga said at the start of Monday's session.

 By law, the court has until Saturday to rule. The Supreme Court's verdict on the case is final, and both Odinga and Kenyatta have said they will abide by its decision. 
 Kenyatta, who faces charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court related to violence after the 2007 vote, won 50.07 percent of votes cast.

AfD politician 'censored' under new German hate speech law for anti-Muslim tweet,"A top lawmaker from the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was blocked from Twitter and Facebook on Monday after slamming the Cologne police for sending a New Year's tweet in Arabic. 
 The incident caused the AfD to lash out further and criticize censorship as a controversial new German social media law known as NetzDG went into effect January 1 in a bid to clamp down on online hate speech.

 The Cologne police tweeted New Year's greetings and linked to information on celebrating safely in a series of messages in German and other languages, including Arabic. Cologne was the scene two years ago of mass sexual assaults on New Year's Eve in which most of the suspects were described as young men of North African and Arab origin. 
 ""What the hell is happening in this country? Why is an official police site tweeting in Arabic? Do you think it is to appease the barbaric, gang-raping hordes of Muslim men?"" wrote Beatrix von Storch, the deputy leader of the AfD's parliamentary group. 
 The tweet was later deleted after Twitter froze von Storch's account and informed her she had violated hate speech rules. Her account was shut down for 12 hours. The Cologne police said on Monday that they had filed a criminal complaint against von Storch for hate speech.

Tanzania leader released on bail,"Freeman Mbowe, the chairman of Tanzania's opposition party Chadema has been released on bail by a local court, a day after police shot dead two anti-government protesters.After being released along with a group of other opposition legislators and their supporters on Thursday, Mbowe urged his followers to continue to fight for their rights. 
 ""We are brave leaders, we will keep fighting for our rights without fear, we will not be afraid to suffer or get injured while defending our nation and we are requesting the youth, women and elders of Arusha, to understand that we know there are laws and orders of ruling the country,"" he said.Following his release, Mbowe and other Chadema leaders visited a local hospital where a dozen opposition supporters were admitted with gunshot wounds and other injuries after riot police fired at crowds of protesters during a banned rally in the northern town of Arusha on Wednesday.Several thousand supporters of the Chadema party had gathered in the town centre to protest what they say was the fraudulent re-election of Jakaya Kikwete, the president, in October. 
 Several protesters were taken in by police who fired to disperse crowds trying to march on the police headquarters. 
 The provincial police chief said 49 Chadema members had been arrested, including Mbowe and Wilbrod Slaa, the party secretary-general and who ran in the October presidential election and finished second. 
 Mbowe said they had information that the police had used live ammunition which caused deaths during the protest. 
 ""A lot of people have been shot by live bullets and some have been fatal,"" he said.
