271553,True Federalism: Southern governors must work together  – Ambode,"[""Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State says southern governors must come together to resolve issues of common interest. Ambode spoke while welcoming his colleagues from the southern part of the country who stormed Lagos on Monday for their meeting under the aegis of the Southern Governors Forum. Extracts from his address:"",""We will recall that the maiden gathering of this forum was held in 2001 at the Akodo Beach Resort, Ibeju Lekki, here in Lagos."",""The initiative to set up the SGF was received with mixed feelings at the time. There were those who read partisan political moves into the idea. Others saw it as essentially sectional and potentially divisive while some dismissed the SGF as another superfluous talk shop of doubtful utility."",""However, the convener of the inaugural edition of the forum and my illustrious predecessor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, gave a robust articulation of the necessity for the forum in his address to participants, which remains relevant and pertinent even today. On that occasion he said, “We are of course aware that our northern brothers have met regularly and publicly articulated common positions of interest in the polity. While some have condemned such meetings, I believe very strongly that such fora should indeed be actively encouraged and supported. Our democracy and federal system can only be strengthened when various groups and component parts of the country are free to discuss and pursue their perceived common aspirations within the framework of the law."",""There are unquestionably issues of common interest to us as governors of states in the southern region of Nigeria. This does not mean that there are no matters which the South-West, the South-East, or the South-South, respectively, may feel constrained to pursue separately at other fora”."",""From its modest beginning in 2001, the SGF held at least nine meetings over the following four years with the last one taking place again in Lagos on Friday, 25th  February, 2005. During this period, the forum became a significant voice on matters of critical import both to the south and to Nigeria as a whole."",""Perhaps, we need to quickly remind ourselves some of the landmark achievements obtained through the pressure exerted by this forum in the past. The first was its collective advocacy for the special allocation to oil producing states in the federation account which resulted in the current formula of 13% accruing for Derivation in allocating revenues from the Federation Account."",""Another major victory won towards strengthening the country’s practice of true federalism was the declaration by the Supreme Court in 2002 that the then prevalent practice of the federal government deducting monies from the Federation Account as a first line charge for the funding of Joint Venture Contracts, NNPC priority projects, servicing of Federal Government’s external debt, the judiciary and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and other federal obligations were illegal and unconstitutional."",""The Supreme Court in that case abolished the special funds created by the Federal Government to enable it draw funds from the Federation Account to pay for matters that fell within its exclusive responsibility before sharing whatever was left with the states and local governments."",""Despite these successes, there is still a lot to be done. There is certainly a lot to be done about true federalism; an issue that requires urgent, meticulous and proactive attention by this forum."",""o less disturbing is the failure to undertake the periodic review of the revenue allocation formula as provided for by the constitution to reflect evolving realities. This is another critical matter that ought to engage this forum in order to enhance the viability of the states and local governments as well as their capacity to fulfill their developmental roles in the polity. All too often, states are disparaged for always carrying begging bowls to Abuja in quest of hand-outs from the federal government."",""This is a function of our present national constitution that burdens the federal government with activities and responsibilities that rightly fall within the province of the states. The productivity and revenue-generating capacities of most of the states are thus stifled thus turning them into no better than street beggar states incapable of even meeting routine obligations of paying workers’ salaries and pensions without federal support."",""Lagos State has fought and won several legal battles since 1999 that has systematically strengthened her autonomy and enhanced her fiscal viability. Over the years, the state has won legal control over the management of its environment, control of urban and physical planning, regulation of overhead masts, registration and regulation of hotels and restaurants and control of her inland waterways. And these victories do not belong to Lagos alone, but to all other states in the federation and which they must explore significantly."",""I believe that If Lagos has been able to achieve so much fighting singly, the SGF can accomplish much more by thinking, planning, strategizing and acting together."",""This resuscitation of the SGF is coming at a most appropriate time. As we are aware, the Senate and House of Representatives are currently harmonizing their differences on the proposed amendments to the 1999 constitution before they are transmitted to the state Houses of Assembly for approval. It is important for this forum to comprehensively look at the proposed amendments with a view to working with our respective Houses of Assembly to ensure a coordinated response on our part that will strengthen the practice of democracy, federalism, constitutionalism and the rule of law."",""In our deliberations, particularly on the pressing need for greater devolution of powers, responsibilities and resources from the centre to the states, our preoccupation must not be with having a weak centre and strong states or vice versa. Rather, in the words of the Indian politician and statesman, Bhupesh Gupta, on the floor of the Indian parliament on May 9th, 1969, “Therefore, we want a centre which will function on the basis of democratic principles and safeguard the unity and integrity of the nation as a whole; whereas at the same time we must have the states enjoying a wide range of powers, economic, political and otherwise, in order that out of this arrangement there develops a symphony of centre-state relations to the common good of the people of the country. There is no contradiction between having a democratic and viable centre and having at the same time, strong, democratic states”.""]",vanguardngr.com/2017/10/true-federalism-southern-governors-must-work-together-ambode

Ads on websites such as Planemart.com offer Douglas DC-8s – four-engined jets –for as little as $275,000 (£170,000)."",""The court statements show the extraordinary lengths to which traffickers are going to exploit the new air routes."",""The Valencia-Arbelaez gang used detailed spreadsheets to compute flight costs and distributed codebooks to conceal their plans."",""Planning sessions were held in Denmark, Spain, Romania and Manhattan. At one meeting, gang leader Jesús Eduardo Valencia Arbelaez sketched a map of West Africa showing points where the drugs would be delivered."",""Fuel and pilots were paid for through wire transfers, suitcases filled with cash and, in one case, a bag containing €260,000 (£220,000) left at a hotel bar. The gang hired a Russian crew to move a newly acquired plane from Moldova to Romania, and then to Guinea."",""Most of the cocaine was destined for Europe, but part of each shipment was supposed to go on to New York."",""\""I sold airplanes to these people so I knew what was going on,\"" Manuel Silva-Jaramillo, an American aeronautical engineer, told a judge. \""I knew that they were bringing the drugs to the United States.\"""",""The gang also discussed setting up a methamphetamine lab in Liberia and exporting the drug to Japan and the US."",""The gang had access to a private airfield in Guinea, was considering buying its own airport and had sent a team to explore whether it could send direct flights from Bolivia to West Africa, Valencia Arbelaez said in recorded conversations."",""A plane seized in Sierra Leone in July 2008 with 600kg of cocaine belonged to the group, the DEA says."",""The European drug market was hugely profitable. Silva-Jaramillo claimed the gang had as much as €60m stashed in Spain that it needed to launder."",""Valencia Arbelaez admitted cocaine trafficking and was sentenced in July to 17½ years in prison. A conspirator, Javier Caro, received 3½ years. Silva-Jaramillo and two other men have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing."",""Drug trafficking is especially dangerous to West Africa because of the corrupting effect it has on already weak governments, Felbab-Brown said."",""In the Liberia case, traffickers offered bribes to Fumbah Sirleaf, the head of the Liberian security agency and son of the country's president. Sirleaf was secretly co-ordinating with the DEA."",""The flights were to come from Venezuela and Panama. The ring had already sent aircraft into Liberia, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, one of the traffickers was recorded saying."",""The case has attracted attention in Russia because one of the defendants, a Russian pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, says he was tortured by Liberian police before being handed over to the DEA. He and the other five defendants deny the charges against them."",""The Russian foreign ministry accused the US of \""kidnapping\"" Yaroshenko.

329626,Group of Emerging Nations Plans to Form Development Bank,"[""JOHANNESBURG — A group of five emerging world economic powers met in Africa for the first time Tuesday, gathering in South Africa for a summit meeting at which they plan to announce the creation of a new development bank, a direct challenge to the dominance of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund."",""The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, all members of the so-called BRICS Group of developing nations, have agreed to create the bank to focus on infrastructure and development in emerging markets. The countries are also planning to discuss pooling their foreign reserves as a bulwark against currency crises, part of a growing effort by emerging economic powers to build institutions and forums that are alternatives to Western-dominated ones."",""“Up until now, it has been a loose arrangement of five countries meeting once a year,” said Abdullah Verachia, director of the Frontier Advisory Group, which focuses on emerging markets. “It is going to be the first real institution we have seen.”"",""But the alliance faces serious questions about whether the member countries have enough in common and enough shared goals to function effectively as a counterweight to the West."",""“Despite the political rhetoric around partnerships, there is a huge amount of competition between the countries,” Mr. Verachia said."",""For all the talk of solidarity among emerging giants, the group’s concrete achievements have been few since its first full meeting, in Russia in 2009. This is partly because its members are deeply divided on some basic issues and are in many ways rivals, not allies, in the global economy. "",""They have widely divergent economies, disparate foreign policy aims and different forms of government. India, Brazil and South Africa have strong democratic traditions, while Russia and China are autocratic."",""The bloc even struggles to agree on overhauling international institutions. India, Brazil and South Africa want permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council, for example, but China, which already has one, has shown little interest in shaking up the status quo."",""The developing countries in the bloc hardly invest in one another, preferring their neighbors and the developed world’s major economies, according to a report released Monday by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development."",""Just 2.5 percent of foreign investment by BRICS countries goes to other countries in the group, the report said, while more than 40 percent of their foreign investment goes to the developed world’s largest economies, the European Union, the United States and Japan."",""Africa, home to several of the world’s fastest-growing economies, drew less than 5 percent of total investment from BRICS nations, the report said. France and the United States still have the highest rate of foreign investment in Africa. Despite China’s reputation for heavy investment in Africa, Malaysia has actually invested $2 billion more in Africa than China has."",""Still, 15 African heads of state were invited to the summit meeting in South Africa as observers, a sign of the continent’s increasing importance as an investment destination for all of the BRICS countries."",""China is in many ways a major competitor of its fellow BRICS member, South Africa. South African manufacturers, retail chains, cellphone service providers, mining operations and tourism companies have bet heavily on African economic growth and in some ways go head-to-head against Chinese companies on the continent."",""South Africa is playing host for the first time since becoming the newest member of what had been known previously as BRIC. Many analysts have questioned South Africa’s inclusion in the group because its economy is tiny compared with the other members, ranking 28th in the world, and its growth rates in recent years have been anemic."",""In an interview last year with a South African newspaper, Jim O’Neill, the Goldman Sachs executive who coined the term BRIC, said South Africa did not belong in the group."",""“South Africa has too small an economy,” Mr. O’Neill told the newspaper, The Mail \u0026 Guardian. “There are not many similarities with the other four countries in terms of the numbers. In fact, South Africa’s inclusion has somewhat weakened the group’s power.”"",""But South Africa’s sluggish growth has become the rule, not the exception, among the onetime powerhouse nations. India’s hopes of reaching double-digit growth have ebbed. Brazil’s surging economy, credited with pulling millions out of poverty, has cooled drastically. Even China’s growth has slowed."",""And once welcome, Chinese investment in Africa is viewed with increasing suspicion."",""On a visit to Beijing last year, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa warned that Chinese trade ties in Africa were following a troubling pattern."",""“Africa’s commitment to China’s development has been demonstrated by supply of raw materials, other products and technology transfer,” Mr. Zuma said. “This trade pattern is unsustainable in the long term. Africa’s past economic experience with Europe dictates a need to be cautious when entering into partnerships with other economies.”"",""Mr. Zuma appeared to have a change of heart before the summit meeting, saying Monday that China does not approach Africa with a colonial attitude."",""But other African leaders are not so sure. Lamido Sanusi, governor of Nigeria’s central bank, wrote in an opinion article published in The Financial Times this month that China’s approach to Africa is in many ways as exploitative as the West’s has been."",""“China is no longer a fellow underdeveloped economy — it is the world’s second-biggest, capable of the same forms of exploitation as the West,” he wrote. “It is a significant contributor to Africa’s deindustrialization and underdevelopment.”""]",nytimes.com/2013/03/27/world/africa/brics-to-form-development-bank

On the agenda was politics, diplomacy, security and business."",""Mr Netanyahu announced he would be attending the inauguration in a speech marking the death 44 years ago of former Israeli premier Ben Gurion. In the speech, Mr Netanyahu spoke with nostalgia of Gurion’s foreign policy mantra — the Periphery Plan — through which Israel ignored hostile neighbours and courted Turkey, Iran and Ethiopia to be its allies."",""“We are in an unprecedented [diplomatic] boom, not only with our great friend the United States, Russia, the Asian countries — especially China, India and Japan — but also Latin America, Australia, and African countries, where I will be going next week for the third time in a year and a half,” Mr Netanyahu was quoted by sections of the Israeli press as telling a faction of the ruling Likud party."",""Israeli-Africa Summit"",""His one-day trip to Nairobi, Mr Netanyahu said as he boarded the plane, “is to deepen ties with Africa, including by establishing connections with nations with which we do not have diplomatic relations.”"",""Earlier he had told legislators that he would be meeting 11 African leaders — it turned out to be 10 — during President Kenyatta’s inauguration."",""READ: Magufuli's absence at Uhuru fete raises eyebrows"",""The trip was the prime minister’s third to Africa in 18 months.

In the meantime, Israel is coming back to Africa in a big way,” he wrote on his Facebook page."",""That rapprochement appears to be paying dividends faster than Mr Netanyahu envisaged.

Our people deserve better lives and we can provide that for them,” he said."",""“I would like very much not only to co-operate on an individual basis with each of your countries and with Kenya but also with the African Union. I hope that we all find a way to have Israel become an observer in the African Union because we can help,” he said."",""Kenya set alarm bells ringing in Israel when on the sidelines of the Africa-Arab Summit in 2013, President Kenyatta showed willingness to accept a Palestinian embassy in Nairobi."",""Israeli observer status at Africa’s apex organisation was revoked in 1973 when 25 states of the then Organisation of African Unity (OAU) severed diplomatic relations with Israel during the Yom Kippur war, when a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria waged war against Israel."",""Israel is concerned that Palestine, its main rival, already has observer status at the AU and is allowed to address the Heads of State Summit."",""READ: UN Vote: Tough talking Israel recalls diplomats, cuts aid to Senegal"",""International relations scholar Dancun Ojwang noted that Mr Netanyahu’s visit endorses the position of US and Western countries, who have shown a willingness to work with African leaders, even those whose legitimacy is in doubt."",""“If you see Israel, you see America.

329532,Feuding Kenyan Leaders Meet,"[""NAIROBI, Kenya — After a week of playing political hard-to-get that put this country on edge and caused Kenya’s stock market and currency to slide, Kenya’s feuding president and prime minister finally met Tuesday."",""The two sat down and talked for more than an hour in President Mwai Kibaki’s office in downtown Nairobi, the capital, according to Kenyan lawmakers. “It was a good meeting,” said Jakoyo Midiwo, a political ally of the prime minister, Raila Odinga. “They agreed to address the issues that divide us.”"",""Mr. Odinga and Mr. Kibaki had been locked in a bruising political impasse for more than a week, after Mr. Kibaki revoked Mr. Odinga’s suspensions of the ministers of agriculture and education on suspicion of corruption."",""The acrimony between them is hardly new. Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga have been rivals for years, and it was a disputed election between them in 2007 that caused Kenya to crack open in ethnic violence that killed more than 1,000 people. After that, under intense international pressure, Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga joined together in a so-called grand coalition government. But the coalition has been roundly lambasted as dysfunctional, corrupt and a “grand letdown,” with this impasse being one of the low points."",""If there is a single issue that continuously holds Kenya back, that retards its economy, discredits its judiciary, poisons its politics, and impoverishes its people, it is corruption. Independent audits have been delving into reports of graft, and the day before Mr. Odinga suspended the two ministers, Mr. Kibaki suspended several high-ranking civil servants. But Mr. Odinga said more action was needed, and moved against the Agricultural and Education Ministries, both of which have been hit by staggering corruption scandals."",""In the Agricultural Ministry, the audits found that officials cut sweetheart deals in which grain from Kenya’s emergency reserves was sold at subsidized prices to political cronies at a time of looming famine. The result was that the cronies made enormous, under-the-table profits, the national grain reserves dwindled, food prices spiked and people in the hinterland starved."",""At the Education Ministry, the accusations involved the disappearance of millions of schoolbooks and chunks of donor money."",""On the afternoon of Feb. 14, Mr. Odinga abruptly announced the suspensions of the ministers and said that he was referring their cases to criminal prosecutors. A few hours later, Mr. Kibaki derided those moves, saying Mr. Odinga had no such power. For much of the past week, Kenya’s two top officials appeared to studiously avoid each other, despite urgings from Kenya’s biggest aid donors to reconcile. The two were supposed to meet on Sunday to resolve their differences, but the meeting was postponed without explanation."",""Many Kenyans have asked why Mr. Kibaki reflexively reinstated the ministers whose departments had become incubators of graft. One interpretation is that he wanted to humiliate Mr. Odinga and show that, despite the facade of a coalition government, the president still holds all the power. Political analysts say that Mr. Kibaki also wanted to cozy up to the large ethnic voting bloc behind the agricultural minister, William Ruto."",""Likewise, many people here suspect Mr. Odinga of being motivated not so much by genuine anguish over corruption but by more selfish political calculations. He may have announced the suspensions, the conventional wisdom goes, to cut the charming, ambitious Mr. Ruto off at the knees. Mr. Ruto used to be a political ally but seems ready to challenge Mr. Odinga to become the opposition’s candidate in the next presidential election in 2012."",""“This is not about corruption,” said John Githongo, Kenya’s former anticorruption chief who now runs a grass-roots political organization. “That’s nonsense. It’s about politics and political alignments in the build-up to the next election.”"",""Much of the governmental in-fighting goes back to the violent days in 2007 and early 2008 when Kenya violently split along ethnic lines after the flawed election. Kenyan human rights groups have said that Mr. Ruto is suspected of orchestrating some of the bloodshed by inciting members of his ethnic group to kill members of the president’s ethnic group. The International Criminal Court at The Hague is investigating the case, and Mr. Odinga has said he will cooperate with the court, which has been interpreted as meaning that he would allow Mr. Ruto to be tried in Europe."",""If that happens — though many Kenyans doubt it ever will — political analysts say that Mr. Ruto’s ethnic community, the Kalenjin, will vent their rage toward Mr. Odinga. That could make it very difficult for Mr. Odinga if he runs for president again in 2012, because it was in no small part the large bloc of Kalenjin votes that made him the leading contender in 2007, and possibly even the winner, had there not been widespread fraud.""]",nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/africa/24kenya
