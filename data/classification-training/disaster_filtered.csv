No hypothesis is ruled out or favored, French President Francois Hollande told reporters in Paris, where he confirmed the plane, with 66 people on board, had crashed. He said the French government is in contact with Egyptian and Greek authorities to help in the search mission."",""EgyptAir said it lost contact with the Airbus A320 plane at about 2:30 a.m., Cairo time, when the airliner was at an altitude of about 11,278 meters and just 16 kilometers inside Egyptian airspace."",""Greek defense minister Panos Kamennos said the plane made sudden turns and a sharp descent before disappearing from the radar."",""It turned 90 degrees left and then a 360-degree turn toward the right, dropping from 38,000 (11,582 meters) to 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) and then it was lost at about 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), he said."",""In Cairo, the aviation minister said neither a terror attack nor technical problem could be ruled out. As he spoke, relatives of those on board had gathered at the airport, anxiously awaiting news on their loved ones."",""Aviation experts are warning against speculation, reiterating that at this point too little is known to draw any conclusions."",""I will say that when an airplane disappears at 37,000 feet its a highly unusual event, Scott Hamilton of Leeham Aviation Consultancy told VOA.

336852,Drought Kills Wildlife in East Africa,"[""NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - A searing drought has killed dozens of hippopotamuses and other wild animals in Kenya and neighboring Tanzania, and disrupted the annual migration of wildebeests and zebras between the two East African nations, conservation officials said.  "",""Maasai warriors and others are driving tens of thousands of cattle inside Kenya's wildlife sanctuaries in search of pastures and water -- risking attacks by wild animals, Kenya Wildlife Service spokeswoman Connie Maina said Saturday.  "",""The drought has so far killed at least 60 hippopotamuses in Kenya's wildlife sanctuaries. The animals -- the third-largest living land mammals, after elephants and white rhinos -- need large quantities of water or mud to cool bodies, which can weigh up to 3.5 tons.  "",""\""Whenever there is a drought, the first casualties are usually hippos who live in the water,\"" Maina said.  "",""Some 40 endangered Grevys zebra -- the largest, wildest and most untamable of the three zebra species remaining in Africa -- have died from anthrax near the Samburu Game Reserve, Maina said. Natural anthrax's bacillus spores can live for decades in dry soil and are ingested by animals rummaging for vegetation during droughts.  "",""Some of Africa's most rare and treasured species live in natural habitats in Kenya and Tanzania, in at least 80 national parks and game reserves. Tanzania, East Africa's largest country, has set aside more than 25 percent of its land for the conservation of the rich wildlife.  "",""In Kenya's Amboseli National Park, the drought has reduced large parts of the land to a dusty field.

"",""\""We see the physical appearance of the big herbivores like elephants and buffaloes getting worse,\"" said Samson Lenjir, deputy senior warden of Kenya's Maasai Mara Game Reserve. \""The situation is expected to get worse because the rains are expected in mid March.\""  "",""The drought has partly disrupted the migration of more than 1.5 million wildebeests, zebras and other herbivores from the Maasai Mara to Tanzania's fabled Serengeti National Park.  "",""The annual migration has been described as the most dazzling wildlife spectacle on earth.  "",""The animals thunder into the Serengeti plains to feed off the new grass and to calve \""because the grass is more nutritious, with a lot of calcium, which is crucial for milk production,\"" said Titus Mlengeya, chief veterinary officer with the Tanzania National Parks Authority.  "",""The animals migrate into the Serengeti through the western, central and eastern corridors. The rains, however, ended prematurely along all routes except for the west, the only area where animals have calved well, wildlife officials said.  "",""The rain failure triggered a critical shortage of pastures and water for the large herds of animals that had begun to calf.  "",""\""They have no milk and are forced to move frequently. In that confusion, many calves are lost and die because they cannot survive on anything other than milk,\"" Mlengeya told the AP.

Searchers there recovered 153 complete corpses as well as fragmented remains before halting their efforts, said Yushau Shuaib, a spokesman for Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency."",""It is unclear from the fragments collected how many victims there are, officials said, acknowledging that a complete death toll could likely take weeks."",""\""I think we can only be sure of the number at the end of the scientific investigation that is going on,\"" Lagos state attorney general Ade Ipaye said."",""Officials now plan to survey the neighborhood to find who remains missing after the plane smashed into two apartment buildings, a printing business and a woodshop, Shuaib said. Those still missing would be presumed dead until DNA testing or other forensic tests links them to the dead, officials said."",""During a news conference Wednesday, authorities said relatives of the dead should come to Lagos to provide tissue samples and be photographed. However, such DNA testing likely would need to be done outside of Nigeria, a nation with erratic electricity from a state-run power company and a largely mismanaged government."",""The cause of the crash on a sunny, clear Sunday afternoon remains unknown. The flight's captain radioed Lagos as the aircraft approached and declared an emergency, saying both of the MD-83's engines had failed, Aviation Minister Stella Oduah said Wednesday. The plane crashed minutes later."",""Ogboro and others declined to speculate what could have made both of the aircraft's Pratt and Whitney engines go out in the last minutes of the flight."",""Authorities already have collected the flight voice and data recorders from the airplane and plan to send them to the United States for analysis Thursday, Oduah said. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board also has sent an investigator to assist Nigeria's Accident Investigation Board, which probes airplane crashes."",""Families and diplomats continued to attempt to identify the dead, hampered by conflicting flight manifests."",""On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the number of dead American citizens in the crash had risen to nine from seven."",""Britain's foreign ministry said that Antonia Attuh, a woman with dual Nigerian and British citizenship, died in the crash. Indian diplomats also believe Indian national Rijo K. Eldhose and flight co-pilot Mahendra Singh Rathore, an American of Indian origin, also were killed, said Rani Malik, an officer at India's High Commission in Lagos."",""Others killed in the crash included at least seven Americans, at least four Chinese citizens, two Lebanese nationals, a French citizen and a Canadian, officials have said."",""Popular anger has risen in Nigeria against the airline since the crash. On Tuesday, the Nigerian government said it had indefinitely suspended Dana Air's license to fly as a safety precaution. However, while offering sympathy for those who died in the crash, Ogboro predicted the airline would resume operations within a few weeks after proving to the government its fleet of MD-83s are safe."",""\""We ensure that we go by the rules,\"" he said. \""I am almost certain they will find that we have not done anything contravening the aviation rules, because all of those aircraft are well maintained.

Meanwhile, the threat from Islamic militants hasn't disappeared, and France is giving its troops a new and larger anti-terrorist mission across the region."",""A senior French official said it seems unlikely that fighters in Mali had the kind of weaponry that could shoot down a jetliner at cruising altitude. While al-Qaida's North Africa branch is believed to have an SA-7 surface-to-air missile, also known as MANPADS, most airliners would normally fly out of range of these shoulder-fired weapons. They can hit targets flying up to roughly 12,000-15,000 feet."",""The crash of the Air Algerie plane is the latest in a series of aviation disasters."",""Fliers around the globe have been on edge ever since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared in March on its way to Beijing.

Finally, on Wednesday, a Taiwanese plane crashed during a storm, killing 48 people."",""It's easy to see why fliers are jittery, but air travel is relatively safe."",""There have been two deaths for every 100 million passengers on commercial flights in the last decade, excluding acts of terrorism. Travelers are much more likely to die driving to the airport than stepping on a plane. There are more than 30,000 motor-vehicle deaths in the U.S. each year, a mortality rate eight times greater than that in planes."",""Swiftair, a private Spanish airline, said the plane was carrying 110 passengers and six crew, and left Burkina Faso for Algiers at 0117 GMT Thursday (9:17 p.m. EDT Wednesday), but had not arrived at the scheduled time of 0510 GMT (1:10 a.m. EDT Thursday).

The six crew members were Spanish, according to the Spanish pilots' union."",""Swiftair said the plane was built in 1996, with two Pratt \u0026 Whitney JT8D-219 PW engines."",""Swiftair took ownership of the plane on Oct. 24, 2012, after it spent nearly 10 months unused in storage, according to Flightglobal's Ascend Online Fleets, which sells and tracks information about aircraft.

155095,Flooding: To be Nigerian and human,"[""Over the weekend, photographs of the flood that hit Lagos surfaced online, and most of us could not help but gasp at the unsightly images of filth in our environment that nature had forcefully unearthed and thrust in our faces. The debris floating on the flood waters contained an alarming amount of non-bio degradable materials, enough to trigger palpitations in an environmentalist. What have we done that such level of pollutants subsists in our surroundings? How was it possible that people lived in that environment and let such level of filth overwhelm them? How accustomed are we, Nigerians generally, to the decay around us that such monstrosity has not mattered as much? Were there no officials from the Lagos State Ministry of The Environment that inspected these neighbourhoods and attempted a clean-up before now?"",""Looking at the bigger picture, I wonder about Nigeria and her enforced environmental policy to control the amount of trash daily launched into our environment to stem the long-term debilitating effect on our ecosystem. All over Nigeria, the effect of mistreating the environment stares us in the face. We are facing deforestation as our biomes gradually disappear, no thanks to our unrestrained habit of plundering without ploughing. Some parts of Nigeria are threatened by desertification and rather than a plan to control it, all we hear are laments. One only needs a view of our cities from an airplane to be depressed about the lack of aesthetic consideration in the planning of our poorly planned city spaces. You can fly over large swathes of Lagos without encountering greenery whereas there is a park right in the heart of Manhattan, one of the most urbanised spaces in the world."",""All around us, we see the effects of our cavalier attitude exacerbating the rage of nature, but we do not see commensurate concerted efforts to address them. Have Nigerian agencies measured the potentially harmful effects of waste materials that swamp our environment on humans, animals (marine and terrestrial), food sources, and our overall quality of life? There are data from other countries that assess the toll different waste products generated in daily activities take on the environment, but when it comes to Nigeria, credible data is both scarce and scant."",""As scientists from developed countries study the harmful effects of non-degradable materials on the environment, they also investigate alternative modes of waste disposal to protect our ecosystems. Where is Nigeria in this noble task, one wonders? Where are our universities and their department of sciences to intervene? Where are the Nigerian activists-researchers, people who will not merely tell us what is wrong with the state of our environment but will conjoin advocacy with their scholarship?"",""One of the photographs that surfaced from the Lagos flood so aptly captured some of the symptoms of the Nigerian malady it was almost iconic. In the photo was a group of men, sitting at a table laden with bottles of beer while their legs were buried in the dirty flood waters that had yet to recede. I stared at the picture for a long time, disheartened over the resilience of Nigerians and how it has enabled us to wallow in a culture of underdevelopment. Here was a group of young men apparently unperturbed by the level of brokenness that surrounded them. They are the age group that should be thinking of solutions to Nigeria’s problems, but they could not be bothered as long as their mouths could be serviced, and their desire for sensual pleasures met."",""A part of me wanted to shake the men out of what I considered their numbing desensitisation to rot before it occurred to me that their numbing might, in fact, be an expression of the Nigerian existential reality: it is possible to live in Nigeria all one’s life and never know beauty. “Beauty,” in this sense, refers to comeliness, an absence of dysfunctionality, and a constant stream of qualities present in our one’s environment that gives one an inner pleasure and satisfaction."",""In other words, it is possible to be born in Nigeria, and to die, without ever living fully as a human given to any kind of aesthetic appreciation. From the hospitals, we are born to the social and physical environment where we grow and are socialised, to the time we go for the NYSC and join the protruded job market, to the quality of life we live and to the way we die, the Nigerian existence is an extended cycle of dysfunctionality. People who are born into debilitated conditions may not know better, and cannot be too bothered about how much their environment dehumanises them."",""With the shame the Lagos flood evoked, the state agents have promised to embark on sensitisation efforts to get people to clean up after themselves. While that is a useful first step, I believe we need to do much more than moral suasions or forceful application. When I was growing up in Ibadan, there used to be multiple radio messages that tried to sensitise people to the benefits of proper waste disposal but more than two decades later, the city is still one of the dirtiest in Nigeria. The problem is complex and superficial measures such as planting flowers or employing street sweepers do not scratch the surface of it. We cannot evaluate the filth that has overtaken our society without investigating the correlation between how we treat our environment, how we are conditioned to think of ourselves as humans living in a physical environment, and the quality of humanity our society bestows on us. Dysfunctionality has a signalling effect such that reproduces it the conditions that created it."",""It is therefore not enough to “sensitise” people to the state of their environment; we need to humanise ourselves as well. We need to develop a state of mind that believes that to be Nigerian and be human are not antithetical. We need to teach ourselves that of all animals, man is the only one capable of cleaning after himself and we need to do just that because the state of our environment is a direct measurement of our humanity."",""Rather than bicker over religious education in our schools, we should be committing efforts to developing the knowledge on how to subdue the rage of nature so that we do not eventually perish under the weight of ignorance and negligence. We also need to cultivate the sublime by nurturing our spirits to appreciate and desire beauty. We need to teach arts to our children in schools – music, poetry, fine art, and design – in addition to a civic orientation that will make people uneasy with throwing their trash any and everywhere. Our cultural industries also have a duty to promote our environment. Hollywood films like Noah and Moana carry environmentalist messages that subtly appeal to the society to respect nature. Our films, particularly Yoruba ones, need to do more than rehash clichéd narratives of witches and “Babalawos” with an infinite capacity to resolve human problems. Their vacuous didacticism is not only jaded; they ignore the more urgent issues facing our society and which can be addressed with indigenous cultural philosophy. Why obsess about evil forces that supposedly steal people’s destinies when we are facing the devastating effects of deforestation?"",""None of what I have suggested above should be taken as an absolution of the government and its responsibility. The Nigerian government at all level has a crucial role to play in facilitating an agenda that improves the state of our environment. They have the duty to make policies and provide the infrastructure that enables compliance with those policies. It is the responsibility of the government to plan our public spaces with a foresight that factors our climatic conditions, our growing population, our present and future needs, and what is sustainable. There is also economic opportunity in environmental protection that is practically begging to be tapped. A vibrant recycling industry alone can provide jobs for thousands of Nigerians all over the country. These things are vital to our humanity because, without beauty, what do we have over animals?"",""Copyright PUNCH.\nAll rights reserved.

Heidar Alishvandi, the governor of Qeshm Island, was quoted by state-run television as saying that rescue teams were deployed to the affected areas.\nIran's seismologic center said the epicenter was in the waters of the Persian Gulf between the port city of Bandar Abbas and Qeshm Island. The quake was felt in nearby Oman and the United Arab Emirates.\nTehran's seismologic center said the quake measured magnitude-5.9. But the U.S. Geological Survey said it was magnitude-6.1 and placed its epicenter about 58 kilometers (36 miles) southwest of Bandar Abbas.\nA magnitude-6.0 quake can cause severe damage.\nMasoud Dalman, head of Hormozgan province's emergency affairs, said several buildings on Qeshm Island were damaged. The island is about 1,500 kilometers (940 miles) south of Tehran, the capital.\nShahram Alamdari, head of the rescue unit for the Iranian Red Crescent, said two helicopters were evacuating the injured from Qeshm to Bandar Abbas, a city of half a million that was also jolted by the quake.\nProvincial official Ghasem Karami told The Associated Press that high casualties were not expected as the area is sparsely populated. He said fewer than 120,000 people live in an area of 1,500 sq. kilometers (579 sq. miles) of the island.\nFirst television images of Qeshm showed minor damages to some buildings and a few injured being rushed to hospital.\nThe TV report said the villages of Karavan and Kousheh were worst hit by the quake; no footage was shown of those sites.\nThe quake cut telephone links between Qeshm Island and the mainland, the television said.\nIn Oman and the United Arab Emirates, buildings were evacuated and people fled into the streets.\nIn Dubai, one of the seven emirates of the UAE, buildings were evacuated as people scrambled for safety.\n\""We're all agreed that it lasted around 30 seconds or so — you could feel the building moving and the coffee cups shaking,\"" said Bina Mathews, a public relations executive.\nSeveral buildings along Dubai's Sheik Zayed Road, the skyscraper-lined central business district, have been evacuated, including the twin Emirates Towers, the highest buildings on the street, where many international corporations and Dubai government institutions have offices.\nIran is located on a number of seismic fault lines and, on average, experiences at least one slight quake every day.\nThe last major quake to hit southern Iran came in February, when a 6.4-magnitude rocked Zarand, a town of about 15,000 people in Kerman province, about 970 kilometers (602 miles) southeast of Tehran. It killed 612 people and injured more than 1,400, leveling several villages and leaving thousands of people homeless.\n""]",nytimes.com/2005/11/27/world/africa/earthquake-in-iran-kills-10-injures-more-than-50,2005-11-27T05:00:00.000Z
