345581,A look at the main defendants in the case against Greece's extreme right Golden Dawn party,"[""ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Six leading lawmakers from Greece's far-right Golden Dawn Party were arrested in the last week following a probe into the party's alleged illegal activities. The arrests came after anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas was stabbed to death last month, allegedly by a man involved in Golden Dawn. Here's a look at the six lawmakers:"",""Nikos Michaloliakos"",""The 56-year-old extreme rightist founded the Golden Dawn party in the early 1980s and spent decades trying to galvanize support. He was jailed in the late 1970s for his connection to a string of bombings of that included movie theaters screening films from the Soviet Union. For years, he wrote articles praising Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, but he dropped the wartime references in recent years, describing Hitler only as \""a great historic personality.\"""",""Golden Dawn was a fringe party for much of its existence but its support exploded after Greece sank into a financial crisis in 2009 and the party began patrols in areas with high crime, which it blamed on immigrants. In 2012, Golden Dawn rose to win nearly 7 percent of the vote and 18 seats in the 300-member Parliament. It's now the country's third most popular party."",""Ilias Kasidiaris"",""The 33-year-old special forces veteran is a rising star in Golden Dawn, a spokesman who is openly racist, athletic and prone to explosive outbursts. He has a university education, a swastika tattoo on his arm. He won notoriety last year after slapping Communist lawmaker Liana Kanelli, 59, in the face on live television. He has already declared himself to be a candidate for mayor of Athens in the vote next year."",""Christos Pappas"",""The son of an army lieutenant general who was staunchly loyal to Greece's 1967-74 military dictatorship, the 51-year-old Pappas is a top party ideologue with links to European fascists. He started a publishing company in the mid-1990s selling extreme-right literature, when Golden Dawn saw an increase of interest amid a wave of nationalism sweeping the Balkans after the fall of Communism in eastern Europe. Police say his home in northwest Greece was filled with Nazi memorabilia."",""Ilias Panagiotaros"",""Burly and bald, the 40-year-old Panagiotaros runs a sports goods and army surplus store. Considered one of the party's chief activists, he once led an ultra-nationalist football fan group. Panagiotaros speaks fluent English and often stands at the front of party protests aimed at aggressively disrupting opponents' gatherings. He also played a significant role in supporting Golden Dawn's vigilante-style patrols of run-down neighborhoods and its Greeks-only food distributions."",""Yiannis Lagos"",""There's no mistaking Lagos, 41, with his muscular physique and a handlebar mustache that he recently grew out into a full beard. He represents a run-down area west of Athens where Golden Dawn has made significant gains and where the left-wing rapper Fyssas was stabbed to death. The area is a political battleground with the far left. Lagos is at the center of the current criminal probe: he was remanded in custody pending trial -- the only lawmaker to be jailed. A date has not been set."",""Nikos Michos"",""The 44-year-old is a close ally of Michaloliakos. He rarely seeks the limelight but is a front-line member of the party's aggressive public actions, including party inspections of open air markets, aimed largely at rooting out immigrants.""]",ap.com/A look at the main defendants in the case against Greece's extreme right Golden Dawn party,01-10-13 20:00,

He spoke with Julius Barigaba on various issues, including allegations that he has been meeting Rwandan President Paul Kagame."",""..............................................."",""What is your reading of the current political environment?"",""We are in a constitutional wilderness, an absence of rule of law and absolute impunity in the management of State affairs. What is critical is that since 1980, no leader has ever handed power to another peacefully. What we are witnessing now, is historical."",""I was a member of the National Resistance Army (NRA) which started a war on account of rigged 1980 elections. During the war, we discussed how transition from military to civilian rule should be managed. It is that transition that never happened."",""All this time we have been in a struggle to subordinate the guns; we are in the second phase of that struggle."",""The first being the struggle against guns held by the British, and the second phase, being guns that came into Ugandans’ hands."",""What have you learnt in this struggle?"",""It has shown us to take a different approach—that there are no good guns and no bad guns. What we achieved during the British colonial administration, the NRA war and even now, was against the magnanimity of those that held guns."",""If you were in power would you be different to Museveni?"",""I have been different for a long time. I was among the very first ‘rebels’ to disagree with Museveni. I parted ways with Museveni ideologically in 1989 and as a result, I was sacked in 1990."",""But this is not because I lost direction. It was him who had veered off the transitional plan that we discussed during the war."",""Violence has followed you every election cycle. Do you see this changing?"",""The constitutional wilderness in which we are cannot be removed. That is why we are now telling our people that Article 3 is the only remaining provision of our constitution that puts a duty on all citizens to do everything in their power to return the country to constitutional rule."",""We have since 2016 been focused on empowering citizens with what they need to assert their will. That is why about two weeks ago we started a process of calling for a national convention to deliberate on what we need to do to take back our country to constitutional rule."",""What is the point of running in an election in this kind of situation?"",""People have asked me, why I keep participating in elections well aware that they are inherently flawed. The reason is simple. Elections can offer a tactical advantage to those in the elections, for we believe a liberation struggle has three steps."",""First, the conscentisation of citizens; Two, a state of having organisational competences in the citizenry. Both of these are the most challenging because those in power know they should not happen. That is why we can’t be allowed to hold meetings and why I am pulled out of radio stations, so that information does not reach the people."",""The third step is action. At the beginning of 2019, we were convinced we had achieved conscentisation and citizens’ organisational competences. So 2019 is the year of action."",""How will that action happen when party activities are met with violence?"",""This [violence] is not unique in struggles of this nature. But once the first two stages have been achieved, it is a matter of time before action happens."",""And action will continue until change comes about. It does not mean that on December 31 action stops. We will continue on the path for change because we know the four things used by such regimes."",""First, is to use of terror, not so much to injure the leaders as to paralyse the followers."",""The second is dispensation of favours to disadvantage and impoverish everyone else."",""Propaganda is the other tool, because they control media and use it effectively. It is a huge machinery to paint themselves white and us as evil.Fourth is to manufacture and sustain those they control, which other people call divide-and-rule."",""I am optimistic that in spite of these challenges, all signs show we are approaching a watershed moment."",""Is it you or People Power that is more likely to bring about that change?"",""There is always an attempt to misrepresent a struggle for liberation with a struggle for leadership. There is an attempt to project our struggle as one for leadership because it is an easy one for the regime to use to divide the population."",""For instance, I have not declared that I want to contest in 2021. But this is a deliberate campaign tactic."",""We are doing our part to present a different contract to our people. That is why we have had engagement with People Power, but we shall also engaged all people at a national convention."",""There is talk that on your recent trip outside the country you met President Paul Kagame. What did you discuss?"",""I did not meet President Kagame, and I have no plans of meeting him. The last time I was in Rwanda was when Gen Fred Rwigyema was being formally interred in 1995."",""There is clearly a state of war between Uganda and Rwanda. Museveni has confessed to meeting leaders of armed groups of Rwanda, for whatever reason."",""I do not think Rwanda wants to fight Uganda, because fighting Uganda disadvantages Rwanda in every sense. This cat-and-mouse relationship must be viewed from the Rwandan Patriotic Front’s formative years when Museveni viewed RPF as just an extension of his power."",""As we say in military language, they are now providing covering fire, in saying Besigye is meeting Kagame. But even if I were to meet Kagame, I am not a rebel. I am a legitimate leader. I have every right to meet our regional leaders whether they are from Rwanda, Kenya or any other country."",""The East African Community, which Museveni claims to champion, is a co-operation of the EAC citizens not EAC regimes."",""Exporting nations cited for exceeding allowable levels of chemicals in fresh farm produce."",""At least 10 other ethnic groups have submitted statehood bids in the south.""]",theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/kiza-besigye-will-not-let-up-the-fight-change-democratic-space/4552908-5351028-format-xhtml-ai4gt4,16-11-19 19:00,Uganda

"",""The man's identity was not immediately confirmed, but investigators said they believe he is Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a senior official in Kenya's security services told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the matter was classified.  "",""Kenya police spokesman Gideon Kibunjah issued a statement Friday night denying the claim, saying \""we do not have such suspect in our custody.\""  "",""Nabhan is wanted for questioning by the FBI and the Kenyan police for the 2002 attacks and the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people. Nabhan fled to Somalia after the attacks near Mombasa. Last year U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer accused Islamic radicals in Somalia of sheltering him and demanded they hand him over.  "",""Kenyan civil rights groups have complained that Kenyan anti-terrorism police routinely harass Muslims on behalf of the United States. Past claims of major arrests have turned out to be false.  "",""Nicholas Kamwende, commander of the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit, refused to discuss the matter with the media. Last week the Kenyan police re-issued a wanted poster for Nabhan and distributed it in the Indian Ocean town of Mombasa, where he was born.  "",""The man believed to be Nabhan was arrested last week in Mombasa after a foreign exchange dealer hit a panic button because of the man's nervous behavior, the security official said. Police thought the man resembled Nabhan's photo and arrested him, the official added.  "",""U.S. officials have interrogated the suspect, another law enforcement official said, who also asked not to be named because the matter was classified. The U.S. Embassy in Kenya declined to comment.  "",""The arrest took place just days before the U.S. Embassy in Kenya issued a warning on Tuesday that a possible \""terrorist attack\"" was being planned in Mombasa to coincide with the World Cross Country Championships on March 24. The Kenyan government reacted angrily to the warning. The Kenyan government has a history of playing down any possible terrorist threats to protect its tourism industry.  "",""Al-Amin Kimathi, the executive coordinator of the group Muslim Human Rights in Kenya, said his group was aware of the arrest and investigating. He said the police register listed the suspect's name as Mohamed Abdulmalik Abduljabar.  "",""\""We tried to get access to him, but we could only manage a very brief chat,\"" he said. \""He told us that he was in Somalia. He didn't tell us any details ... he was terrified.\""  "",""The suspect, who is the same age as Nabhan, believed he was going to be flown out of Kenya, Kimathi said. The suspect has a Middle Eastern appearance, he added, like Nabhan.  "",""Terrorists believed to be from an East Africa al-Qaida cell killed 15 people when they drove a car bomb into a hotel near Mombasa on November 28, 2002. Almost simultaneously, members of the group fired a surface-to-air missile at an Israeli airliner taking off from the Mombasa airport. The missile missed.
