The case was never prosecuted, drawing attention to the lingering sense of impunity around sexual violence. The girl was paralyzed from the waist down after her spine was crushed when she was raped, Reuters reported, and her 28-year-old uncle was suspected of the assault."",""Civil society groups have called on the government to act in the wake of reports that cases of sexual and gender-based violence have increased by nearly 10 percent each year since 2015. In 2017, more than 12,000 such cases were reported, according to police data."",""Many cases are never reported, making the actual figure much higher, activists said.

Victims testified during international trials about the brutality of rebels, who used mutilation and rape against the civilian population. One of the hallmarks of the conflict were “bush wives” — women and girls forced into sexual slavery by rebels."",""A United Nations report presented after the end of the conflict found that the expectation of impunity encouraged violence against women."",""But an Ebola outbreak in 2014 wrecked the country and set back its fragile peacetime development, including progress against gender-based violence.

In 2007, the nation introduced legislation to fight domestic violence. It was not until 2012 that the country passed a law criminalizing sex with minors, setting the age of consent at 18."",""The number of convictions in trials for sexual violence continues to lag. Cases are sometimes settled out of court between families. Victims can’t afford to pay for justice, and corruption is rife in the court system, activists say."",""The Rainbo Initiative, an organization in Sierra Leone that helps abuse victims, praised the government’s move to declare a national emergency, according to a statement on Twitter."",""The group said it was overwhelmed with 10 to 15 new cases every day, typically involving girls under 17 — the youngest survivor this year was 12-months-old, and another survivor was pregnant at 12 — who reported that they had been raped by someone they knew. Only 1.2 percent of the court cases for which it provides evidence are successfully prosecuted."",""In an online post, Vickie Remoe, a TV producer and blogger on issues in Sierra Leone, said the law was rarely enforced."",""“Political will alone will not fix the problem.

Before then, he was governor of North Kordofan state."",""The decision comes after a week of successive measures aimed at combating an unprecedented wave of protests threatening President Bashir’s three-decade rule, including declaring a nationwide state of emergency, and sacking the governors of Sudan’s 18 states and replacing them with military and security officials."",""The protests, initially over high bread prices, have taken place nearly every day since December 19, and developed into the most sustained challenge that the president has faced."",""Security forces have used live fire as well as teargas to disperse protestors. At least 33 people have been killed, according to official statistics, including three security personnel. Protesters believe the true toll is higher."",""On Thursday, crowds gathered in and around Khartoum in the first protests since President Bashir set up the special tribunals this past week. They were heeding a call by the Sudanese Professionals’ Association, the main protests organiser, to challenge the establishment of the courts."",""Over 800 people have been sent to trial, the Democratic Alliance of Lawyers, part of the Sudanese Professionals’ Association, said in a statement on Thursday. Trials continued late into the night, with verdicts ranging from release to jail time."",""On Monday, the president issued a raft of edicts banning unlicensed public gatherings and giving tough new powers to police. The new courts, as well as emergency prosecutors, were established across every Sudanese state on Tuesday."",""As he fights to survive until the end of his term, President Bashir will be looking to three key institutions — The Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), and the ruling party. These powerful entities are responsible for keeping him in power, but they may not agree on his successor."",""Mathias Muindi, an independent political risk analyst focusing on the Horn and the Great Lakes, told The EastAfrican that by declaring the state of emergency till February 2020 —two months to the elections — President Bashir is telling the world that he is ready to go, but he is determined to finish his term in April 2020 so that he can manage his succession."",""Potential successors"",""“The challenge is that the opposition organising the protests does not trust anybody with deep links to the NCP and the military, while the armed forces won’t allow a successor fronted by the opposition,” said Mr Muindi."",""President Bashir — who appears to have abandoned the plan to amend the Constitution to allow him to contest in 2020 — is believed to have narrowed down to four names as potential successors."",""These are Mr Haroun, newly appointed First Vice-President and Defence Minister Awad Ibn Ouf, NISS Director Salah Abdallah Gosh, and former governor of Gezira State and Prime Minister Mohammed Tahir Ayala, whom he had picked as his successor in 2017 but saw him rejected by the NCP."",""But President Bashir’s biggest challenge is how to manage the transition. He must take into account the mood within the SAF, which has people indicted for atrocities and war crimes by the ICC and humanitarian agencies."",""Mr Gosh, a 62-year-old veteran, has been involved in Sudan’s intelligence services since the 1980s. The NISS is in charge of the former Janjaweed operatives who have been renamed Rapid Support Forces. They are said to be responsible for violently quelling the protests, and arresting and torturing opponents. They would prefer a transition that does not see them held to account over these allegations."",""Mr Gosh headed Sudan's national intelligence service for about a decade until 2009, when he was appointed presidential security adviser. He was dismissed from that post in 2011, and later in 2012 was arrested for allegedly planning a coup. The president later pardoned him and he was reinstated in February 2018."",""New PM Mr Ayala is an administrator who has the total trust of President Bashir and who has been entrusted with governing the food basket of Gezira and the Red Sea State, which host Port Sudan."",""President Bashir will also be careful not to upset the powerful forces within NCP. While former first vice-president Bakri Hassan Salih has been cast aside in favour of Mr Ouf, he was one of the guards who was with President Bashir in the 1989 coup and who still retains influence within the party."",""Mr Muindi says that President Bashir has three options. He could use the one-year state of emergency to negotiate with the NCP, some members of the opposition and the international community on the guarantees and safety for his family and close allies who could be implicated in corruption, human-rights abuses and financial mismanagement."",""Second, he could leave now but seek to be allowed to pick his successor — which could bring division between the NCP and armed forces. And third, he could hang on until the bitter end, by increasing repression."",""Treasury seeks additional funding of $866m, increasing the 2019/2020 budget to $30.4bn."",""Exporting nations cited for exceeding allowable levels of chemicals in fresh farm produce.""]",theeastafrican.co.ke/news/africa/Bashir-faces-increased-pressure-to-step-down/4552902-5006700-7tyvgnz

At least 33 people have been killed, according to official statistics, including three security personnel. Protesters believe the true toll is higher."",""On Thursday, crowds gathered in and around Khartoum in the first protests since President Bashir set up the special tribunals this past week.

Trials continued late into the night, with verdicts ranging from release to jail time."",""On Monday, the president issued a raft of edicts banning unlicensed public gatherings and giving tough new powers to police. The new courts, as well as emergency prosecutors, were established across every Sudanese state on Tuesday."",""As he fights to survive until the end of his term, President Bashir will be looking to three key institutions — The Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), and the ruling party. These powerful entities are responsible for keeping him in power, but they may not agree on his successor."",""Mathias Muindi, an independent political risk analyst focusing on the Horn and the Great Lakes, told The EastAfrican that by declaring the state of emergency till February 2020 —two months to the elections — President Bashir is telling the world that he is ready to go, but he is determined to finish his term in April 2020 so that he can manage his succession."",""Potential successors"",""“The challenge is that the opposition organising the protests does not trust anybody with deep links to the NCP and the military, while the armed forces won’t allow a successor fronted by the opposition,” said Mr Muindi."",""President Bashir — who appears to have abandoned the plan to amend the Constitution to allow him to contest in 2020 — is believed to have narrowed down to four names as potential successors."",""These are Mr Haroun, newly appointed First Vice-President and Defence Minister Awad Ibn Ouf, NISS Director Salah Abdallah Gosh, and former governor of Gezira State and Prime Minister Mohammed Tahir Ayala, whom he had picked as his successor in 2017 but saw him rejected by the NCP."",""But President Bashir’s biggest challenge is how to manage the transition. He must take into account the mood within the SAF, which has people indicted for atrocities and war crimes by the ICC and humanitarian agencies."",""Mr Gosh, a 62-year-old veteran, has been involved in Sudan’s intelligence services since the 1980s. The NISS is in charge of the former Janjaweed operatives who have been renamed Rapid Support Forces. They are said to be responsible for violently quelling the protests, and arresting and torturing opponents. They would prefer a transition that does not see them held to account over these allegations."",""Mr Gosh headed Sudan's national intelligence service for about a decade until 2009, when he was appointed presidential security adviser. He was dismissed from that post in 2011, and later in 2012 was arrested for allegedly planning a coup. The president later pardoned him and he was reinstated in February 2018."",""New PM Mr Ayala is an administrator who has the total trust of President Bashir and who has been entrusted with governing the food basket of Gezira and the Red Sea State, which host Port Sudan."",""President Bashir will also be careful not to upset the powerful forces within NCP. While former first vice-president Bakri Hassan Salih has been cast aside in favour of Mr Ouf, he was one of the guards who was with President Bashir in the 1989 coup and who still retains influence within the party."",""Mr Muindi says that President Bashir has three options. He could use the one-year state of emergency to negotiate with the NCP, some members of the opposition and the international community on the guarantees and safety for his family and close allies who could be implicated in corruption, human-rights abuses and financial mismanagement."",""Second, he could leave now but seek to be allowed to pick his successor — which could bring division between the NCP and armed forces.

Before then, he was governor of North Kordofan state."",""The decision comes after a week of successive measures aimed at combating an unprecedented wave of protests threatening President Bashir’s three-decade rule, including declaring a nationwide state of emergency, and sacking the governors of Sudan’s 18 states and replacing them with military and security officials."",""The protests, initially over high bread prices, have taken place nearly every day since December 19, and developed into the most sustained challenge that the president has faced."",""Security forces have used live fire as well as teargas to disperse protestors. At least 33 people have been killed, according to official statistics, including three security personnel. Protesters believe the true toll is higher."",""On Thursday, crowds gathered in and around Khartoum in the first protests since President Bashir set up the special tribunals this past week.

Trials continued late into the night, with verdicts ranging from release to jail time."",""On Monday, the president issued a raft of edicts banning unlicensed public gatherings and giving tough new powers to police. The new courts, as well as emergency prosecutors, were established across every Sudanese state on Tuesday."",""As he fights to survive until the end of his term, President Bashir will be looking to three key institutions — The Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), and the ruling party. These powerful entities are responsible for keeping him in power, but they may not agree on his successor."",""Mathias Muindi, an independent political risk analyst focusing on the Horn and the Great Lakes, told The EastAfrican that by declaring the state of emergency till February 2020 —two months to the elections — President Bashir is telling the world that he is ready to go, but he is determined to finish his term in April 2020 so that he can manage his succession."",""Potential successors"",""“The challenge is that the opposition organising the protests does not trust anybody with deep links to the NCP and the military, while the armed forces won’t allow a successor fronted by the opposition,” said Mr Muindi."",""President Bashir — who appears to have abandoned the plan to amend the Constitution to allow him to contest in 2020 — is believed to have narrowed down to four names as potential successors."",""These are Mr Haroun, newly appointed First Vice-President and Defence Minister Awad Ibn Ouf, NISS Director Salah Abdallah Gosh, and former governor of Gezira State and Prime Minister Mohammed Tahir Ayala, whom he had picked as his successor in 2017 but saw him rejected by the NCP."",""But President Bashir’s biggest challenge is how to manage the transition. He must take into account the mood within the SAF, which has people indicted for atrocities and war crimes by the ICC and humanitarian agencies."",""Mr Gosh, a 62-year-old veteran, has been involved in Sudan’s intelligence services since the 1980s. The NISS is in charge of the former Janjaweed operatives who have been renamed Rapid Support Forces. They are said to be responsible for violently quelling the protests, and arresting and torturing opponents. They would prefer a transition that does not see them held to account over these allegations."",""Mr Gosh headed Sudan's national intelligence service for about a decade until 2009, when he was appointed presidential security adviser. He was dismissed from that post in 2011, and later in 2012 was arrested for allegedly planning a coup. The president later pardoned him and he was reinstated in February 2018."",""New PM Mr Ayala is an administrator who has the total trust of President Bashir and who has been entrusted with governing the food basket of Gezira and the Red Sea State, which host Port Sudan."",""President Bashir will also be careful not to upset the powerful forces within NCP. While former first vice-president Bakri Hassan Salih has been cast aside in favour of Mr Ouf, he was one of the guards who was with President Bashir in the 1989 coup and who still retains influence within the party."",""Mr Muindi says that President Bashir has three options. He could use the one-year state of emergency to negotiate with the NCP, some members of the opposition and the international community on the guarantees and safety for his family and close allies who could be implicated in corruption, human-rights abuses and financial mismanagement."",""Second, he could leave now but seek to be allowed to pick his successor — which could bring division between the NCP and armed forces.

Col. Sagir Musa named 11 areas of Maiduguri where people must remain inside their homes until further notice. Musa said it was part of the military's push since President Goodluck Jonathan issued an emergency decree Tuesday allowing soldiers to arrest people at will and take over buildings suspected to house extremists in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states."",""Soldiers arrested some 65 suspected extremists who were \""attempting to infiltrate Maiduguri\"" after military strikes on camps in a nearby forest reserve, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Chris Olukolade said in a statement Saturday. Olukolade said soldiers killed another 10 suspected extremists in Maiduguri's Gamboru neighborhood, one of the areas now under curfew."",""There was no independent confirmation of the arrests nor the killings. An Associated Press journalist in Maiduguri saw roadblocks manned by soldiers in the city, as well as trucks lined up outside the city, apparently blocked by the military from entering."",""Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, once was home to the main mosque of Boko Haram. Nigeria's Islamic extremist insurgency grew out of a 2009 riot led by Boko Haram members in Maiduguri that ended in a military and police crackdown that killed some 700 people. The group's leader died in police custody in an apparent summary execution, fueling dissent that broke into the open in 2010 with the targeted killings of government officials, security agents and religious leaders who spoke out against the sect. The killings gradually morphed into the large-scale extremist network that is plaguing Nigeria today."",""Soldiers backed by jet fighters and military helicopters have flooded into the northeast since Jonathan's order Tuesday. On Thursday, soldiers attacked suspected camps sheltering insurgents in a forest reserve south of Maiduguri. At least 21 suspected extremists died in the attack, an official told the AP on Friday. The military said it destroyed the extremists' equipment and gasoline supplies."",""On Saturday, Olukolade asked the public to inform authorities if they saw anyone attempting to gather large quantities of gasoline."",""\""Some of the fleeing insurgents from various camps have been noted to be in search of fuel,\"" the brigadier general said."",""This new military campaign comes on top of a previous massive deployment of soldiers and police to the region. That deployment failed to stop violence by Islamic extremists, who have killed more than 1,600 people since 2010, according to an AP count. It also has seen soldiers arrest, torture and even kill civilians."",""Boko Haram, whose name means \""Western education is sacrilege\"" in the Hausa language of Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north, has said it wants to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria and wants the government to release all of its imprisoned followers. Boko Haram has sparked splinter groups like Ansaru, which has kidnapped foreign hostages.

Two of its neighbors, Sierra Leone and Liberia, are still struggling to recover from brutal civil wars, and Ivory Coast is split in two after a brief civil war."",""Analysts say sustained unrest in Guinea could lead to another civil war in the region and reignite conflicts in its neighbors, drawing in mercenaries across a region that is awash in weapons.""]",nytimes.com/2007/02/13/world/africa/13guinea

"",""President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed a retired military general, Tunji Olurin, to administer the state and maintain security there for the next six months. He also suspended for six months the state legislature, along with Fayose, his deputy and Friday Aderemi, the former speaker of local parliament who is claiming to be governor.   "",""\""I hereby declare a state of emergency in Ekiti state,\"" Obasanjo said in a national broadcast.   "",""The removal of Fayose was illegal because some steps in the impeachment process violated Nigeria's constitution, Obasanjo said.   "",""The state's chief judge had on Oct. 9 appointed an impeachment panel that legislators alleged was composed of the governor's loyalists. The lawmakers then removed the judge and appointed a new one who set up the impeachment panel that found Fayose guilty of misconduct.   "",""Under the constitution, state legislatures have the power to impeach governors, but only the National Judicial Council, the top federal judicial administrative body headed by the country's chief justice, has the power to remove a state chief judge -- and only then on the recommendation of a governor.
