The anti-graft crusader who admitted that compared with its woeful record of performance in the past, the agency with its record of 160 convictions in one year has put itself in a position of challenge the lack-lustre performance of the Independent Corrupt Practice and related offences Commission which had about 400 cases in court but no conviction."",""“In the past one year, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has secured over 160 convictions in respect of cyber crimes, obtaining by false pretext or “419”, fraud, stealing and other cases. By the standard of any legal system that is a record achievement. But the perception out there is that the anti graft agencies are not succeeding because the fat cats have remained largely untouchable. This picture has begun to change. Just recently, a former commissioner in Adamawa state, local government officials in Kogi state and a former DG of NIMASA were convicted and jailed. With the religious application of the provisions of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 our criminal courts have sped up the trial of criminal exposed persons”, he said."",""The senior lawyer charged the EFCC to give necessary support to President Buhari in his campaign to ensure the return of all money looted in the country and stashed in foreign accounts, adding that all the fantastically transparent countries where these funds are kept should in the spirit of transparency and for the general wellbeing of the people of Nigeria, quicken their repatriation."",""The human rights advocate commended both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal for their collaboratory performance in ensuring that corruption suspects on trial are not using them as refuge to stall or avoid trials. In his view, this had helped in no small way to speed up trials in line with the new Administration of Justice Procedure."",""“Both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal have rejected the clever designs of some accused persons to frustrate their prosecution at the trial courts. The anti graft agencies must therefore team up with the judiciary by ensuring that proper investigations are conducted. The ICPC which has over 400 cases pending in the various state high courts should urgently review them with a view to charging the suspects with money laundering or other federal offences in the federal high court.”"",""He disclosed that he was in possession of documents, which reveals how some Western firms in connivance with their countries of origin, defrauded Nigeria to the tune of about $100 billion. This, he vowed to hand over to the EFCC. “We have decided to submit to the EFCC, evidence of the country’s hydrocarbons valued at over $100 billion stolen by western companies with the connivance of their government”.""]",guardian.ng/news/falana-lauds-efccs-one-year-under-buhari,2016-05-28T00:00:00.000Z

It was an experience that would go on to influence his foreign policy decision making, and help steer US-China relations through several tumultuous decades."",""Known in Beijing as the bicycle-riding envoy on account of the many hours he spent cycling through the capitals narrow hutong alleyways with his wife Barbara, Bush endeared himself to local residents with his down-to-earth practicality and apparent enthusiasm for Chinese life."",""As the US chief diplomatic envoy in China during a period before the US had formally opened an official Beijing embassy, Bush met with several key Chinese leaders, including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, as well as numerous military and diplomatic heads."",""Theres no doubt Beijing sees him as the best friend China has ever had in the White House, certainly in the category of Nixon, said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, referring to former US President Richard Nixon, who opened relations with Communist China in 1972."",""Following Nixons historic visit to Beijing, Washington established a US liaison office in the Chinese capital with a chief envoy to act as an unofficial ambassador in an attempt to help break the ice."",""Beginning in 1974, Bush arrived in the capital aged 50 as the second US envoy to Beijing, during a period in which China had yet to fully emerge from decades of self-imposed isolation."",""He thought the future lay in Asia and the future lay in China, said Engel, of Bushs decision to accept the role in the Chinese capital."",""Bush had traveled to Beijing with the intention of meeting the next generation of Chinas leaders, according to his diary.

"",""Africa's conflicts -- and ways the AU can help end them -- are expected to take center stage during the summit, with leaders set to discuss fighting in war-divided countries, such as Ivory Coast and Congo, and ongoing violence in Sudan's western Darfur region -- acts of which the bloc condemned on Sunday.  "",""\""Let us show to the world that we can really tackle and solve African issues,\"" said Obasanjo, who holds the AU's rotating leadership, as he kicked off the summit in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.  "",""While most of the world has grown wealthier in the four decades since the majority of African countries won independence, the continent has largely grown poorer, a fact the chairman of the Ethiopia-based AU, Alpha Oumar Konare, linked to persistent conflicts.  "",""\""If the security of our continent doesn't improve, no development is possible,\"" he told African leaders.  "",""Obasanjo also condemned recent violence in Sudan's Darfur region, where the United Nations, citing AU observers, has said nearly 100 people were killed when a Sudanese plane bombed their village. Sudanese officials have called the reports unfounded.  "",""\""We can't but condemn such carnage no matter what excuse may be raised to try to justify it,\"" Obasanjo said of the attacks.  "",""At least 40 of Africa's 53 leaders were in Abuja for the twice-yearly, two-day summit.  "",""U.N. reform is also high on the summit's agenda. African leaders are vying for more of a say in U.N. affairs, long dominated by the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.  "",""One possible U.N. reform is expanding the Security Council, and Nigeria -- the continent's most populous nation and a regional political and military heavyweight -- is one of the African country's angling for a permanent seat on a larger council.  "",""The leaders were also expected to consider a Libyan proposal to abolish customs duties between African countries -- a move intended to speed economic integration on the continent and lead to greater political cooperation.
