179598,Current stand-off splits Egypt right in middle,"[""Already dozens of people have died at the hands of their army  the Egyptian army, which has staged a coup, overthrowing a democratically elected government. That a country at the northern gate of Africa, with a unique ancient history of early civilization should perilously drift towards turmoil and bloodshed is both very sad and unfortunate."",""This is an Egypt that we all marvelled at two years ago where change of government had been affected by mere peaceful demonstrations. So how have Egyptian people landed at this spot? What has gone wrong - has it something to do with their constitution? Or has it been failure on the part of those elected to govern, failure to correctly address the social-economic injustice in the country that has driven them to the current spot?"",""These are the questions for the Egyptian people to address on their own. All their neighbours and well wishers all over the world wish for them is to be saved from a civil war, which would worsen their plight even more, in the same way we are witnessing the terrible destruction of Syria."",""For, in the last fortnight, we have seen Egypt split right in the middle. For us, glued to our television sets, we have been shown demonstrations at two levels, presumably demos to mark the second anniversary of the coming to power of President Mohamed Mursi, now overthrown."",""There are Egyptian people supportive of President Mursi and the others who are against him who have been demonstrating. Both demos are gigantic in their own ways. For us non-Egyptians watching these things on television have found nothing terribly wrong with this development."",""Reason: such things are quite normal in a democratic order! But suddenly came, in the course of this divide in terms of support and nonsupport of Mursi, a terse statement from the Egyptian armed forces, literally handing the incumbent President, theoretically its Commander-in-Chief, with an ultimatum."",""It was not revealed what was contained in that ultimatum which was a 48- hour one. When that period lapsed, the army moved. It overthrew the President and, of course, his government. A coup dtat? A putsch? Yes! There is no other name when it involves an army taking over the reins of state power!"",""If I am dwelling a little at this point is because there is reportedly a foreign power, which would automatically react by cutting off aid to a government coming to power via a coup. But as it is known, it is always the interests of that given power that matters and not who is in power!"",""So nothing has happened to the new regime in Egypt, which has come to power via a putsch. But a lot is happening in that country, and very ugly indeed. As I am penning this perspective, the army has killed 51 people. And those killed belong to the pro-Mursi group."",""We have seen them on our TV sets where they have fallen, dead. While their brethren have continued their protests at Nasr city. Those against Mursi, camped at Tahrir Square have not been attacked by the army, which translates to selective engagement, which, does not augur well for the countrys national cohesion."",""We will come back to this point later in the course of this perspective. For those who have been following developments in Egypt following the triumph of the Spring Revolution in the footsteps of the Tunisian one earlier will recall that this is not the first time the Egyptian army had usurped power in Egypt after Mursi, and his party, the Muslim Brotherhood were elected into office."",""As we have seen before, the Supreme Committee of the Armed Forces (SCAF) had relegated to itself the major reins of state power decreeing that an elected president would not assume the position of Commanderin- Chief once voted into office. At that moment when the Egyptian people made their choice of President, the army dissolved a parliament elected earlier!"",""This is the background relating to the conduct of the Egyptian army after the Spring Revolution. As it looks like, Egyptian people have a headache that may persist for a very long time. They will need to find a way to locate the place of their army in a democracy!"",""If Tanzanian history is anything to go by, one may recall what the founding father of this nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere did during the early days of independence from Britain when the army, known then as Tanganyika Rifles (TR) committed a mutiny. To achieve a lasting solution, Nyerere disbanded the whole army bequeathed from colonialists and build a new one, which is what is today the Tanzania Peoples Defence Forces (TPDF)."",""Contextually, the Tanzanian paradigm is poles apart from the Egyptian one. It was a young army officer then called Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser who overthrew the Egyptian monarchy to usher in a revolution led by what was known as the free officers of the Egyptian armed forces."",""This created a tradition of Egyptian army officers- cum-political leaders, counting in its stride men such as presidents Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak, the latter to be brought down by the popular revolution from Tahrir Square in 2011. Thus spoken, it is for the Egyptian people therefore, to chart out what is best for their country and where should everyone belong."",""Perhaps the best route for them would be the constitution. Again that will require leadership that will consistently hammer and imbue into the Egyptian people across the board to appreciate the need for their army to stay in the barracks to defend the country against external aggression and not in political leadership."",""There is another factor that may have contributed to the current situation facing that country in the northern gate of Africa. That is when it has allowed religious political parties to vie for political power. Need arises, therefore, for Egypt to espouse a Secular State by its constitution. Egypt is a multicultural country."",""It has a population affiliated in other religious faiths other than Muslim. As evidenced in the course of history, no religion anywhere can claim to be monolithic. Within Islam itself, there are divisions as there are divisions within Christianity. So Tanzania, like Egypt, can hardly afford political parties rooted in a given religion or tribe because such stance is inherently divisive and anarchic."",""Given its ancient history of civilization one hopes Egypt will overcome its current predicament.

They say he has made himself, his family and some cronies fabulously wealthy while the majority of people in the oil-rich Central African nation struggle in deep poverty."",""Obiang claimed to have won 95 percent of the vote after Equatorial Guinea's election in 2009, making him an unlikely critic of Ivory Coast's incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo, who refuses to cede power two months after the international community said he lost the vote."",""\""Neither the African Union nor Africans deserve a leader whose regime is notorious for abuses, corruption and a total disregard for the welfare of its people,\"" Alioune Tine, president of the Dakar, Senegal-based, African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights, said by phone from the summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."",""Traditionally, the chairmanship is given to the leader of the country hosting the next summit, but an exception was made in 2005 when it was the turn of Sudan's Omar al-Bashir and African leaders bowed to outside pressure in the uproar over killings in Darfur. They passed over al-Bashir and instead kept Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo for a second year."",""There also was dismay when the Africans appointed Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi as chairman in 2009. Gadhafi has ruled Libya since seizing power in a coup in 1969, and was seen as a poor example at a time when Africa's democratic gains were being reversed, a trend that continues today."",""This week's summit, which started Sunday and ends Monday, was dominated by the crisis in Ivory Coast. How African leaders deal with it is important in a year when more than a dozen African countries are to hold elections. Many votes, such as one planned for later this year in Zimbabwe, are likely to be violently contested."",""Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled since 1980 -- despite 2008 elections that were violent and widely condemned as fraudulent -- took part in a meeting to decide \""a democratic solution\"" to the Ivory Coast stalemate."",""Some question whether leaders at the two-day summit are seeing the writing blazed on the wall by Tunisian protesters whose popular revolt ousted 23-year dictator Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali. His was a notable absence from the summit, as was that of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Gadhafi."",""Sudan's president attended, even though students in his nation on Sunday began protests inspired by the success of Tunisia's uprising."",""The African leaders appeared to studiously ignore the extraordinary events to their north, even as they glanced at TV screens showing an Egyptian mall ablaze as days of protests demanding the 82-year-old Mubarak leave power deteriorated into chaotic looting and armed robbery."",""\""It's actually a bit surreal as delegates here watch events in Egypt on the conference hall TV screens and then choose as their leader President Teodoro Obiang, who has ruled Equatorial Guinea for 30 years without allowing a free election. But the winds of change are blowing,\"" said Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch."",""Such protests are unlikely in Equatorial Guinea, where human rights groups say any sign of dissent is met with arrests and incarceration in a prison notorious for torture and starvation. Last year, four alleged coup plotters were executed just an hour after they were condemned."",""Since oil was discovered in Equatorial Guinea some 20 years ago, the country's per capita income has grown larger than that of some European countries, making it the richest nation in sub-Saharan Africa."",""Yet life for the average citizen has become harsher. According to U.N. figures, the number of infants dying has increased, while 30 percent of children complete primary school. Only a third of the population has running water and electricity, and 60 percent live on less than a dollar a day."",""New York-based Human Rights Watch condemned Obiang's appointment and added, \""Even if the AU elects Obiang as its chair, members should not allow him to stall the AU's efforts and progress in tackling African human rights crises,\"" notably in Ivory Coast."",""At a summit with the theme of unity, the Ivory Coast crisis only served to mark fundamental differences among African leaders. West Africans led by economic giant Nigeria stuck to their guns in supporting opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, whom the United Nations and European Union also have recognized as the winner of November elections."",""But South Africa has been suggesting a re-count of votes, supporting the position of the intransigent incumbent, Gbagbo. South Africa's stand is supported by Uganda, Angola and Equatorial Guinea -- all led by men accused of hanging onto power through questionable elections."",""Gbagbo also has suggested a power-sharing deal to resolve the Ivorian stalemate -- much like the unity governments that emerged in Zimbabwe and Kenya after violence-plagued elections, with mixed success."",""South Africa's weekly Mail and Guardian newspaper warned that a power-sharing deal for Ivory Coast \""would solidify the trend begun in Kenya and Zimbabwe of rewarding those who refuse to accept electoral outcomes and who use violence to maintain their grip on power.\"""",""The AU, meanwhile, appointed a panel of presidents from five countries asked to resolve the deadlock in a month -- two from democratic South Africa and Tanzania and three coup leaders from Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania."",""The Ivorian crisis is the first to see the African Union uphold elections that unseat an incumbent."",""Political scientist Adekeye Adebajo, head of the Center for Conflict Resolution at South Africa's University of Cape Town, said the African Union has done well in recent years in dealing with unconstitutional regime changes, foiling attempts to set up military regimes in Ivory Coast, Togo and the Comoros."",""\""But when it comes to dealing with civilians, civilian coups d'etat, they tend to be at a loss,\"" he said. \""I think it's very hard for the African Union to be a promoter of democracy as long as a lot of its members themselves have flawed democratic processes.\""""]","ap.com/Amid democracy challenges, Africans choose dictator Obiang to head African Union"

Youssou Traore, who has long had a fraught relationship with former coup leader Amadou Sanogo, now the highest-ranking official in the Malian military after a serendipitous promotion."",""Traore was arrested around 11 a.m. and a dozen other soldiers are now in custody, according to Lt.

In an address to the nation on television Wednesday night, Keita described the Kati uprising as \""shameful.\"""",""\""I cannot tolerate indiscipline or anarchy in any case,\"" he said, adding: \""Kati will not create fear for Bamako.\"""",""Monday's unrest was an ironic twist of fate for Sanogo, who himself launched a coup from the same Kati military barracks about 18 months ago. That group of mutinous soldiers cited discontent with the way the Malian army was conducting the fight against Tuareg separatists in the north. Army casualties were growing amid reports that soldiers lacked the sufficient weaponry for battle."",""This week, the now Gen. Sanogo came under threat from soldiers who said they had not received the promotions they had been promised. A group of five men burst into the office of Col. Mohamed Elhabib Diallo on Monday morning, firing into the air and taking him hostage. The angry soldiers accused Diallo of removing their names from the lists of candidates receiving higher titles and shot and wounded him."",""One witness described the assailants as armed with grenades and ammunition belts \""like Rambo.\"""",""Soon the soldiers began calling other military camps around Bamako, urging soldiers who also had been denied promotions to join them at Kati."",""By 8 p.m., Sanogo finally agreed to meet with the angry soldiers. Unsatisfied with his response, though, the disgruntled hostage-takers next persuaded the country's new defense minister to visit the camp and hear their appeals."",""\""He told them that their message had been heard, that they should free Col. Diallo and await the arrival of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on Tuesday,\"" said an official in the Defense Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

328978,Burundi Government Says It Has Crushed Coup Attempt,"[""BUJUMBURA, Burundi — Loyalist police and army officers have crushed an attempted coup in Burundi, the government said Friday. The announcement followed two days of confusion over who controlled the central African country, which has been shaken by weeks of violent protests over the president’s ambitions to stay in office."",""Despite the official declaration that the overthrow plot had been defeated, it was by no means clear that stability would soon return to Burundi, which has suffered a long history of upheavals. United Nations officials expressed fears about retribution and further violence."",""“I would like to thank the army and the police for defeating the wrongdoers,” the president, Pierre Nkurunziza, said in an afternoon speech from Bujumbura, the capital, broadcast on state radio and television. “There is peace in the country, including the capital city, where those coup plotters were operating.”"",""Still, the extent of the overthrow plot and how it had been thwarted remained murky. A presidential spokesman, Gervais Abayeho, added to the uncertainty with contradictory statements quoted by Reuters about whether the lead coup plotter, Maj. Gen. Godefroid Niyombare, had been arrested."",""The whereabouts of General Niyombare, who just two days earlier had decreed on state radio that the president had been deposed, was not clear as of late Friday."",""An acute political crisis in Burundi has been developing since last month over the president’s decision to seek a third term in the June 26 election despite a constitutional two-term limit. His opponents, who accuse him of corruption, human rights abuses and other crimes, viewed the decision as a bald attempt to extend his power, and street protests turned deadly."",""The coup attempt on Wednesday appeared timed to occur while the president was visiting neighboring Tanzania for a conference. He returned to Burundi on Thursday, first landing in his home territory in the northern part of the country to rally support before traveling to the capital to make clear that he was still in charge."",""The president’s critics have called for more protests. Many fear that he will now systematically crack down on civil society groups, independent press, activists and anyone who may be perceived to have supported the coup attempt. Their concern was shared by the top human rights official at the United Nations, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein."",""“I am deeply worried by the extremely tense situation in Burundi,” he said in a statement. “We are receiving alarming messages from human rights defenders and journalists fearing for their safety.”"",""There is also fear that revenge attacks will worsen a refugee problem as Burundians worried about persecution flee to neighboring countries."",""“While the coup attempt is reported to have been foiled, the situation in Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura, remains tense with sporadic outbursts of violence reported this morning,” the United Nations refugee agency said in a statement."",""It said that more than 105,000 people had fled, mostly to Tanzania, and that the rate of departures had doubled in the past week. The rush of refugees was overwhelming an encampment in Kagunga, Tanzania, Karin de Gruijl, a spokeswoman for the refugee agency, told reporters in Geneva. “The lack of clean drinking water, latrines and shelter is acute,” she said."",""In Bujumbura, the streets were quiet on Friday morning, with many people deciding not to go to work. Clutches of police officers and soldiers loyal to Mr. Nkurunziza could be seen maintaining order. The gunfire of the past few days had largely subsided."",""Later, throngs of Mr. Nkurunziza’s supporters could be seen celebrating in the streets."",""The violence surrounding his effort to prolong his rule reflects a wider phenomenon in Africa — particularly in countries that are trying to achieve stability after conflicts — in which leaders have clung to power, sometimes for decades. Regional experts said the coup attempt, even though it appeared to have failed, was nonetheless a sobering message to other longtime African leaders."",""“The administrations in Uganda and Rwanda and other leaders in the region will be looking at Burundi and registering that there is a very high price to be paid for miscalculating the level of popular support for repeatedly extending presidential mandates,” said Michela Wrong, the author of several books on Africa."",""President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders, has been in power since 1986, when he toppled Tito Okello, a dictator who had overthrown the country’s democratically elected president. But in recent years, opposition to Mr. Museveni has grown amid rising concerns that he is determined to be president for life."",""In Rwanda, supporters of President Paul Kagame, whose influence extends across the continent and who has support in the West, have been clamoring for a constitutional change that would permit him to run for a third term, in 2017. He was elected in 2003 but has been in control of the country since the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide in 1994."",""Ms. Wrong said Mr. Nkurunziza’s aspirations of longevity were part of a power pattern in much of Africa: Leaders of countries torn by civil war or other conflicts seek to perpetuate their rule, abetted by weak democratic institutions and an unwillingness to groom successors or yield to rivals."",""“They stay in power because the economy is in the hands of a tiny elite of cronies surrounding the president, and if they leave, they or their families can risk being prosecuted,” she said."",""Burundi’s Constitution stipulates that the president can hold office only for two five-year terms. Mr. Nkurunziza has been in office since 2005, but he contends that his first term should not count toward the limit because he was not directly elected when he first became president."",""A court ruled that Mr. Nkurunziza could run again because he was appointed by Parliament, but his opponents have questioned the legitimacy of that decision."",""The country has been recovering after a protracted civil war, which began in 1993 and left an estimated 300,000 people dead, after the first president to be elected from the country’s Hutu majority, Mechior Ndadaye, was killed by troops from the Tutsi minority."",""During the civil war, Hutu rebel groups fought against the army, which was under the control of the Tutsis, fostering anger and resentment among the Hutu majority.

49806,Burkina coup supporters storm hotel hosting mediators,"[""Dozens of supporters of the Burkina Faso military coup on Sunday chanted slogans and wrecked furniture as they stormed a Ouagadougou hotel hosting efforts to end the country’s post-putsch crisis, an AFP journalist said."",""The attack came as mediators led by Senegalese President Macky Sall — who also chairs the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) — were due to announce an exit plan Sunday morning for the landlocked west African country from the crisis triggered by Thursday’s military coup."",""An AFP journalist at the scene said the supporters of General Gilbert Diendere were clearly aiming to pressure the mediators, who also include the UN representative in Africa Mohamed Ibn Chambas."",""The scuffle came a day after Benin’s President Thomas Boni Yayi, who was in Ouagadougou meeting both sides in the standoff, announced “all the actors” in the crisis would meet Sunday to announce “good news”."",""Though he did not specify exactly what the announcement would be, he did hint at a return to power of Burkina’s interim government."",""Arriving before any announcement could be made, Diendere’s supporters forced their way into the hotel, caused mayhem in the lobby and took off again."",""“What we want is for Diendere to stay and organise elections quickly like he promised. We are killing each other in the neighbourhood and the country because of exclusion, we need inclusive elections,” a Diendere supporter said on condition of anonymity."",""The Presidential Security Regiment (RSP), an elite army unit of 1,300 men loyal to former president Blaise Compaore, officially declared a coup on Thursday and announced Compaore’s ex-chief of staff Diendere as the new leader."",""Just before Diendere’s supporters arrived, protesters from the “Balai citoyen” (Civic Broom) movement that led an uprising which deposed Compaore last October, also gathered outside the hotel, seeking to “maintain pressure” on the talks until an announcement was made."",""At least 10 people have been killed and 113 wounded in clashes sparked by Wednesday’s detention of the interim president and prime minister a by presidential guard officers, a source at Ouagadougou’s main hospital told AFP.""]",guardian.ng/news/burkina-coup-supporters-storm-hotel-hosting-mediators
