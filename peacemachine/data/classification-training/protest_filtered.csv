It happened in Libya.\"""",""Labor unions called the strike after President Goodluck Jonathan's administration announced Jan. 1 it unilaterally removed subsidies that kept gasoline prices low in the nation of 160 million people. The decision saw gas prices rise from $1.70 per gallon (45 cents per liter) to at least $3.50 per gallon (94 cents per liter). That spurred a spike in prices for food and transportation across a country where most live on less than $2 a day"",""Cheap gasoline remains the only noticeable benefit for Nigeria's public after 50 years of oil production that has seen military leaders and politicians embezzle billions in government funds. Gasoline also remains vital in a nation where electricity remains scarce."",""\""People have to understand that in the West, petrol is for your car. In Africa, in Nigeria especially, petrol is your life,\"" said musician Seun Anikulapo-Kuti, son to the late Afrobeat legend Fela. \""There's no light without petrol. Everybody runs a generator.\"""",""The scope of the strike Monday became clear at first light in Lagos. The typically snarled streets of the commercial capital stood empty. Trade unions set up informal roadblocks, aided by local gang members who attacked cars of those driving in spite of the strike."",""More than 10,000 people later gathered at a public park in Lagos, with nearly everyone shouting their criticisms of Jonathan and Nigeria's federal government. Placards and banners bore an effigy of Jonathan with devil horns and fanged teeth, working as an attendant at a gas station. In Nigeria's capital Abuja, thousands also demonstrated in the streets."",""While most businesses remained closed Monday, some flights left Lagos' Murtala Muhammed International Airport. Oil production also apparently continued in Nigeria, which produces about 2.4 million barrels of oil a day and remains a top crude supplier to the U.S. However, the unions representing oil workers had promised to go along with the national strike."",""Activists also wore shirts bearing symbols for a loose-knit group of protests called \""Occupy Nigeria,\"" inspired by those near Wall Street in New York. The anger of those gathered also extended to the government's weak response to ongoing violence in Nigeria by a radical Muslim sect that, according to an Associated Press count, killed at least 510 people last year."",""Famous Nigerian authors, including Chinua Achebe, issued a statement Monday saying they supported the strike, and warning that if left unattended the violence by the sect known as Boko Haram could sweep the country."",""\""The country's leadership should not view the incessant attacks as mere temporary misfortune with which the citizenry must learn to live; they are precursors to events that could destabilize the entire country,\"" their statement read."",""Police largely stood by as some protesters lit bonfires and pulled metal barriers into a Lagos highway. As officers picked up the barriers, some demonstrators moved to help them."",""In the Ogba neighborhood, however, witnesses and a doctor said a police officer opened fire on a group of protesting youths, killing one and wounding four others. An angry crowd later pushed the corpse through the neighborhood in a wheelbarrow, shouting promises of revenge, setting fires and knocking over police traffic posts."",""The police officer accused of killing the protester has been arrested, Lagos state police spokesman Samuel Jinadu said."",""In Nigeria's second-largest city of Kano, protest organizer Ashiru Sharif said two young men were shot dead by security officers who opened fire on a crowd of chanting protesters."",""\""We were not attacking anybody,\"" said Sharif, adding that 24 other peaceful protesters were wounded."",""Meanwhile, angry protesters attacked the seat of Kano's state government, setting offices and cars ablaze, local police commissioner Ibrahim Idris said. Security officers there shot at the mob, resulting in a stampede that left seven wounded, Sharif said. Authorities later set a dusk-to-dawn curfew to tamp down on the violence."",""Violence also cut across religious lines in Nigeria, which is divided into a largely Christian south and Muslim north. In Edo state, state police commissioner David Omojola said that a mob attacked a Muslim neighborhood in the southwestern city of Benin, leaving people injured. Rioters also attempted to torch a mosque, but were stopped by the police, Omojola said."",""It remains to be seen how long the strike will last. The unions have said described it as indefinite, saying they'll only stop if the government restores the fuel subsidies. Jonathan has remained adamant the subsidies must remain in place to save the country about $8 billion a year, money he says will go toward badly needed road and public projects."",""But Monday's demonstrations show Nigerians as a whole appear unwilling to let the government in a nation where corruption runs rampant have any more money."",""\""Corruption is the bane of this nation,\"" said Udoka Iloba, a 40-year-old accountant. \""Nigerians are tired.\"""",""------"",""Associated Press writers Ibrahim Garba in Kano, Nigeria; Lekan Oyekanmi in Abuja, Nigeria and Yinka Ibukun in Lagos, Nigeria contributed to this report."",""------"",""Jon Gambrell can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP[http://www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP].""]","ap.com/Widespread anger over gas prices, corruption emerges as paralyzing strike begins in Nigeria"

338477,Kenya protesters set fire to building; Annan set to start mediation,"[""NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Dozens of protesters set fire to a government office building Wednesday, forcing workers to crawl out windows as former U.N. chief Kofi Annan tried to resolve the deadly dispute over Kenya's presidential election.   "",""The melee started after police fired tear gas at stone-throwing youths during a memorial service organized by the opposition to honor those killed in Kenya's postelection violence. Some 685 people have been killed in riots and ethnic fighting since the Dec. 27 vote.   "",""\""This is a war between the people of Kenya and a very small bloodthirsty clique clinging to power,\"" opposition leader Raila Odinga told about 800 supporters gathered at a sports ground in the capital, Nairobi.   "",""Just outside the grounds, young men were stopping cars, beating people and taunting police. Police held fire but eventually responded with tear gas, some of which landed inside the sports ground and forced the mourners to flee. About 50 of the young men then set upon the government-owned telecommunications building, smashing windows and starting fires.   "",""\""We don't know what happened,\"" Mary Bwire, a secretary at the office, told The Associated Press. \""Suddenly there were stones everywhere. We all hid under tables.\""   "",""She and several other employees crawled out ground-floor windows to safety.   "",""Later Wednesday, Kenya's opposition called off plans for a day of protests set for Thursday under pressure from Annan, a small victory on the former U.N. chief's first day of mediation. Police have banned all rallies, and at least 24 people died in three days of protests last week. Most deaths were blamed on police.   "",""\""On the request of the mediation team we have called off the activities we had planned for tomorrow,\"" William Ruto, a leading opposition figure, told a news conference in the capital, Nairobi.   "",""The election returned President Mwai Kibaki to power for another five-year term, but the opposition and international observers say the vote tally was rigged.   "",""Also Wednesday, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) outside Nairobi in Limuru, police fired shots at men with machetes who had been blocking the road and demanding to know the ethnicity of people trying to pass, witness Nancy Chumba said by telephone. Two people were fatally shot, according to a police source who asked that his name not be used because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Another two people were found dead in the capital's slums, police said.   "",""Annan is the latest international figure to try to intervene in the standoff. The chairman of the African Union, Ghanian President John Kufuor, failed even to persuade Kibaki and Odinga to agree to meet.   "",""The fighting has pitted protesters against police, but there also have been clashes between members of Kibaki's Kikuyu ethnic group and other tribes. During Wednesday's memorial service, Odinga said Kenya's 40-plus tribes should not be at war with one another.   "",""Beatrice Michael Achieng, 35, was at a mortuary Wednesday that was the starting point of the opposition's memorial procession. She was collecting the body of her 13-year-old daughter, who was shot outside their home in a Nairobi slum.   "",""\""I think the protests should stop. I don't want to hear about Raila. I don't want to hear about Kibaki. My daughter is gone and we need peace,\"" Achieng said. \""I am feeling very bitter and angry at the police. I haven't eaten since the day my daughter died. She was my first born and I've even thought of hanging myself.\""   "",""Both sides in the dispute have traded accusations of who is behind the violence, with the government and the opposition each saying they will take the other to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands.

Breakdown: Observers ID cards 70, 000 copies. Observers jacket: 70,000 pieces at N500 each, totalling N350m; 70,000 pieces of Fez caps at N1, 500 each to cost N105m; 70,000 folders at N800 each at a total of N56m; 70,000 jotters at N300 each for N21m.\n“70,000 CDs bearing information at N1,000 each to cost N70m; 70,000 stickers.”\nThe commission earmarked N630m to monitor primaries across the country.\nINEC noted that it would cost N27.8m to monitor presidential primaries while about N420m would be spent monitoring governorship, senatorial, federal constituency and state constituency primaries. It also budgeted N182m to support states and LGAs for the conduct off primaries.\nThe electoral body earmarked N7.6bn to print 15 million Permanent Voter Cards at the cost of N510 each.\nAttempts to get INEC to comment on the possible effects of the delay in approving the budget did not succeed. When contacted on the telephone for comment, the INEC National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Publicity, Prince Solomon Soyebi, said he would respond via a text message. However, he had yet to do so as of press time.\n \nLaws regulating budgets must be amended –Okonjo-Iweala\nThe immediate past Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, says there is a need for the laws regulating the passage of budgets to be amended.\nOkonjo-Iweala said this at the signing and reading of her new book titled, Fighting Corruption is Dangerous: The Story Behind the Headlines in Abuja on Saturday.\nThe former minister was reacting to a question on Nigeria’s budget system and the usual rift it causes between the National Assembly and the Presidency.\nShe said budget impasse could affect investor confidence and portray Nigeria as a dysfunctional country to the outside world.\nOkonjo-Iweala noted that in 2013, former President Goodluck Jonathan almost did not sign the budget because a lot of the projects and items he included in the budget were been removed by the legislature.\nThe former minister stated, “So, my thinking now is that we need to step up and put together some independent committee or commission, including people from outside, who know how budget process works combined with respected people from inside because we have them.\n“Independent-minded people, who sit down and help us to hammer out where does the prerogative of the executive start and stop; where does the prerogative of National Assembly stop. If we can put that together, it would be preferable.\n“But we have to translate it into laws which will help govern our budget process. We must do this because as long as it is left open, every time it is time for budget, the argument will arise. If that doesn’t work, then maybe the matter should go to the Supreme Court.\n“I think we need to get it into the constitution. There are some countries like South Africa that have financial rules written into their constitution and it makes the life of the finance minister so easy because nobody can argue because if you do, it becomes unconstitutional.”\nShe said there was a need to ensure that all Nigerians accused of wrongdoing are punished but it must be done in such a way that justice is not selective.\nOkonjo-Iweala said, “We have a country where there is a lot of impunity and when there is punishment it doesn’t always fall evenly. I think that is why there is so much cynicism. What we need is to get away from impunity but let it be even.\n“Let it not be seen as directed at one group or the other; one section of people or the other or whatever it is. In any administration, we have got to get to a level where we wield the instrument of power and punishment properly without fear or favour.”\n\nN242bn 2019 poll budget too high, says Transparency Int’l \nMeanwhile, the Transparency International said on Saturday that the budget of  N242bn  to prosecute the 2019 Nigeria’s general elections was unacceptable and showed that the facilities used in 2015 were not properly maintained.\nThe Head of Transparency International, Nigeria, Musa Rafsanjani, who stated this in an exclusive interview with one of our correspondents, said the budget was too expensive.\nHe noted that some facilities used for the 2015 elections ought to be utilised in 2019, so that the election budget would not amount to a wastage of government fund.\nIt was reported two weeks ago that President Muhammadu Buhari sent a virement proposal of N228.8bn to the National Assembly.  Buhari had said INEC and security agencies would need N242bn for the 2019 general elections.\nThe TI Head, Nigeria, Rafsanjani, said on Saturday that the Federal Government needed to review the budget for the 2019 elections.\nHe said, “If the government had done due diligence, the cost of running the 2019 elections would have been much cheaper. We must not turn our election cycle to an opportunity for duplication of statutory allocations and a waste of the previous facilities that were procured.\n“I think the Nigerian election is becoming embarrassing because no part of the world is spending this kind of resources carelessly.\n“We are talking about the cost of governance. The question we need to ask is: what happened to the previous election facilities such as vehicles used in 2015?\n“The Nigerian government should seriously begin to review the cost of governance. We are wasting a lot of public funds that should have been used to address poverty and unemployment.”\nCopyright PUNCH.\nAll rights reserved.

7801,Three killed in Kenya's Mombasa riots after cleric shot dead,"[""MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Two Kenyan police officers and a civilian were killed when rioters hurled a grenade at officers in the port city of Mombasa on Tuesday after two days of violence over the killing of a radical Muslim cleric."",""Mobs of youths had fired at police with machineguns just before throwing the grenade into a police truck, Benedict Kigen, a senior police intelligence officer said."",""The riots broke out on Monday after Aboud Rogo, accused by the United States of helping al Qaeda-linked Islamist militants in Somalia, was shot dead. Gunmen sprayed Rogo’s car with bullets in an attack many Muslims in Mombasa blamed on the police, who denied involvement."",""Police said at least 16 police officers were wounded in the grenade attack in Kisauni, a predominantly Muslim area, where youths set two churches on fire and barricaded roads with burning tyres as the riots spread to the outskirts of Kenya’s second-biggest city, a tourist hub and major Indian Ocean port."",""“These are pure criminals, and now terrorists are infiltrating within to launch grenades at us. They are looting even chicken,” Kigen told Reuters."",""The city’s main streets, usually thronged with shoppers and foreign tourists, were deserted and some shops were shuttered. Shopkeepers reported looting in some areas of the city and police said rioters had looted and set fire to a bank."",""“People are breaking into our shops and looting our property and police are doing nothing,” said Francis Mutua, 33, a kiosk owner who said he and his colleagues had beaten up an offender."",""Shopkeeper Kassim Ali also complained about police as they cleared a smouldering roadblock nearby. “These people, the police, are joking. They are taking this thing lightly, but the way I see it, it will not be good,” he said."",""One person was killed in riots on Monday when protesters set fire to several churches, stoking fears that the unrest may become more sectarian in a city where grenade attacks blamed on Somali militants and their sympathisers have already strained Muslim-Christian relations. Mombasa has a big Muslim minority."",""Police and Muslim leaders had described the church burnings as impulsive, not premeditated. On Tuesday the gangs of youths appeared to focus their anger more on the police."",""Church leaders scrapped plans for a peaceful march on Tuesday for fear it might incite further clashes in a country where overall relations between Muslims and Christians have been relatively good."",""“We have been asking how we will defend ourselves. We are wondering how the killing of Rogo was related to churches and Christians. Muslims are now against the Christians and that is what we need to concentrate on,” said Bishop Lawrence Dena."",""Sheikh Mfaume Bakari Mfaume, representing Muslim clerics at a meeting called by Muslim and Christian clerics to end the violence said: “Muslims did not plan these attacks. These were rogue youths, and the fact that they might be Muslims doesn’t drag the entire Muslim fraternity in this.”"",""Washington and Nairobi had both accused Rogo of helping al Shabaab, Somalia’s Islamist rebel group."",""The al Qaeda-linked militant group urged Kenyan Muslims on Tuesday to protect their religion at all costs and boycott next year’s presidential election. It condemned what it called a “witch-hunt” against Muslims by the Kenyan authorities."",""“Muslims must take the matter into their own hands, stand united against the Kuffar (non-believers) and take all necessary measures to protect their religion, their honour, their property and their lives from the enemies of Islam,” al Shabaab said in a statement posted on the social media site Twitter."",""The violence could worsen if it taps into long-standing local grievances over land ownership and unemployment, as well as calls by the Mombasa Republican Council MRC.L for the coastal strip to secede. The MRC said it was not involved in the unrest."",""Prolonged trouble in Mombasa would hit Kenya’s vital tourism industry, already damaged by the kidnappings of Western women tourists from beach resorts by Somali gunmen, at the height of the tourist season."",""“Right now we have closed all our tourists in the hotels. We can’t take them on safaris, we can’t take them on tours of cultural sights ... because it is unsafe,” said Titus Kangangi, owner of the Platinum hotel just north of Mombasa."",""Mohammed Hersi, who runs the Whitesands Hotel, the largest resort on the coast, said tourists were worried. “It’s tricky to even take them or pick them from the airport because the main highway from the airport is the epicentre of the chaos.”"",""The unrest could also knock trade and transport to Kenya’s landlocked neighbours. Rwanda and Uganda rely on Mombasa port for imports of food, consumer goods and fuel.
