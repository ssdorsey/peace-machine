The Taliban have rejected talking with the government so far, dismissing it as a US puppet."",""Some analysts also have warned that some factions of the Taliban might be expressing displeasure with the U.S. deal, though Taliban political leaders at the talks in Qatar have insisted that their tens of thousands of fighters would respect whatever agreement is reached."",""The militant group is at its strongest since the US-led invasion to topple its government after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S. The Taliban now control or hold sway over roughly half of Afghanistan."",""The United Nations and others say civilians are suffering, often caught in the cross-fire as government forces, backed by the U.S., pursue the militants with airstrikes and raids.

"",""Kiplimo Rugut, the commissioner of Central Province, said Mungiki was suspected in some of the killings, which happened overnight. \""This is a possibility we are looking at,\"" he told The Associated Press.   "",""The violence comes at a tumultuous time in the Kenyan capital, where an explosion earlier this month killed one person and wounded more than 30 during rush hour. No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. In the past month, more than 50 people have been killed in a crime spree and police crackdown linked to Mungiki.   "",""Mungiki claims to have thousands of adherents, all drawn from the Kikuyu, Kenya's largest tribe. The group, whose name means \""multitude\"" in the Kikuyu language, was inspired by the bloody Mau Mau rebellion of the 1950s against British colonial rule. In recent years, it has been linked to extortion, murder and political violence.   "",""The group's founder, Maina Njenga, who has publicly denied links to Mungiki recently but who is widely believed to still be a guiding force, was sentenced to five years in prison Thursday on gun and drug charges.   "",""Meanwhile, a Mungiki leader said the government crackdown has done nothing to stop the secretive group, which makes money by demanding protection payments from minibus drivers and by controlling illegal businesses that produce homemade alcohol or provide electricity to slum areas by rerouting the circuits.   "",""The minibuses, known as matatus, are the main form of public transportation in Kenya.   "",""\""Nothing has changed,\"" the leader told The Associated Press, insisting his name not be published because he is wanted by police. \""Most politicians in this area are affiliated with us in one way or another.\""   "",""He spoke the day before Friday's violence, and could not be reached for further comment.   "",""A senior police officer, who also requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said corruption is the main reason authorities cannot stamp out the Mungiki.   "",""He said officers round people up, then take bribes to release them. \""The officers also tip members of the group to an impending raid,\"" he said.   "",""Simon Kimutai, head of the Matatu Owners Association, said the Mungiki have become so threatening that he is forced to work from his car so gangsters won't find him at his office.   "",""\""I am talking about (the Mungiki) every day and nothing is happening, so what will happen next is that they will come for my head,\"" he said.   "",""Mungiki members have threatened to disrupt the elections in December, when President Mwai Kibaki will seek a second term. Leaflets circulated by the group call on Kenyan youth to join up and prepare for an uprising against the government.   "",""\""Arise! Arise! Arise!\"" one of the leaflets says. \""Stand up for your rights now.\""   "",""Clashes have broken out every election year since 1992, and this year has been no different. Besides the Mungiki violence, land disputes in the Mount Elgon area, 515 kilometers (320 miles) northwest of Nairobi, have killed more than 140 people and forced tens of thousands from their homes.   "",""Much of Friday's violence took place in Banana Hill -- the base of a lucrative matatu route -- and the eastern Nairobi neighborhood of Kariobangi, where residents have long complained that Mungiki runs vast extortion rackets. Three corpses, included two who were beheaded, were found in Banana Hill, on the outskirts of Nairobi, police said.   "",""Another beheaded victim was found in the city center, said police official Tito Kilonzi said.   "",""\""If you look at the way beheading was done, it leaves us with little doubt that it was Mungiki,\"" he said.   "",""The violence in and around Kariobangi killed eight people, starting when gunmen stormed a restaurant and opened fire, said police official Maina Migwi. A truck driver and two passengers also were killed, he said.   "",""\""They did not steal anything from the victims in all the incidents last night,\"" Migwi said, suggesting that the violence was a way to instill terror in the area.   "",""Police also fatally shot eight men who were trying to rob a warehouse of the  Kenya Electricity Generating Company Ltd., said Julius Muthuri, police official in Nairobi's industrial area. KenGen produces about 80 percent of the electricity consumed in the country.   "",""Police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said authorities believe the suspects at KenGen were trying to steal materials to use for illegal electricity connections -- a hallmark, he said, of the Mungiki sect.

Many governments have been stockpiling the antiviral drug Tamiflu. But Patrick Deboyser, the EU delegate attending the two-day meeting, said it was preferable to fight bird flu at its source - in animals, and in the Asian countries where serious outbreaks have already occurred.\nIn Brussels, meanwhile, the EU said that at a meeting scheduled in Beijing next week it would pledge $100 million to fighting bird flu.

But Wamang's statements will probably prolong the investigation, as well as complicate the Bush administration's efforts to resume full military relations with Indonesia.
