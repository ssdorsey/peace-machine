"",""The draft must now go to parliament for final passage.  "",""Delegates at a national constitutional conference, which includes lawmakers, women's groups, religious organizations and representatives of Kenya's more than 60 districts, passed the final draft late Monday, Yash Pal Ghai, head of the conference, told The Associated Press on Tuesday.  "",""The drawn-out process of drafting the constitution has been dogged by controversy and caused public disputes in President Mwai Kibaki's government.  "",""A number of senior Cabinet ministers walked out of the conference on Monday, hours before delegates adopted the draft charter.  "",""The ministers were angered that delegates had rejected proposals for a compromise on a disagreements about the powers of the president and the re-creation of the post of prime minister, Vice President Moody Awori said Tuesday.  "",""But Awori said the government was committed to ensuring that Kenya has a new constitution by June 30.  "",""\""It is the wish of the government that the new constitution should be a unifying factor and provide a sound framework for lasting peace, stability and economic and social development for all people of Kenya,\"" he told reporters.  "",""Since independence from Britain in 1963, Kenya has been ruled by autocratic presidents who have amended the current constitution to enhance their powers.  "",""Under the draft constitution, the prime minister -- who would be the leader of the largest party in parliament -- would appoint the Cabinet and chair ministerial meetings. The president, who would be directly elected, would remain head of the armed forces and chair a National Security Council which would be responsible for internal security and defense policy.  "",""Kenya has not had a prime minister since 1964, and the president currently appoints all high-ranking public officials.  "",""Ghai said that the draft constitution would allow Kibaki to retain his enormous powers until the next election, scheduled for 2007. There would also be no prime minister until after that vote.  "",""It is not clear when the draft constitution will be presented before parliament, where two-thirds of Kenya's 222-member National Assembly will have to vote in favor of the charter for it to be adopted.  "",""The 629-member constitutional conference has been deliberating, on and off, since last April.  "",""The draft constitution was initially written by a government-appointed commission and was based on the opinions of Kenyans countrywide.  "",""The commission was appointed by former President Daniel arap Moi in October 2000 after pressure from human rights groups, political activists and opposition legislators.  "",""Moi, who had ruled for 24-years, was constitutionally obliged to step down at December 2002 elections and his Kenya African Union Party, or KANU, was swept from power by an opposition alliance led by Kibaki.  "",""While campaigning ahead of the elections, Kibaki promised widespread reforms and said a new constitution would be adopted within 100 days of his taking office.  "",""But since his National Rainbow Coalition ended the 39-rule of KANU with a landslide victory, the constitutional review process has been marred by disputes and delays.

"",""Instead, the nation is sharply divided as it prepares for a vote Monday on the proposed charter. At least seven people have died in violence at campaign rallies as Kenyans fought over the spirit and the letter of the proposed new charter.  "",""President Mwai Kibaki appealed for calm Friday and said his government would deal firmly with anyone attempting to disrupt the referendum in which voters will choose a banana for yes or an orange for no -- a third of Kenyan adults cannot read.  "",""Rival rallies in Nairobi Saturday will allow both sides a final show of strength before voters cast their ballots at 19,134 polling stations across the country. Kenya has about 11.6 million registered voters, out of a population of 34 million.  "",""There has been only one opinion poll, released by a local firm and Gallup International on Oct. 21. The poll, with a margin of error of two percentage points, showed opposition at 42 percent and support at 32 percent -- leaving a large block undecided.  "",""Opponents say the proposed constitution does not do enough to curb presidential powers. They have cast the vote as a referendum on Kibaki, whom they accuse of abandoning his commitment to democratic reform.  "",""Kibaki has campaigned in favor of the new constitution, though members of his own Cabinet oppose it. Kibaki has argued that the proposed constitution would create a workable balance by dividing power among the presidency, parliament and district governments.  "",""The document on which Kenyans will vote has been public since August, crafted by Attorney General Amos Wako from a draft created by a National Constitutional Conference in March 2004 and one proposed by parliament in July.  "",""Wako's 197-page combination appears closer to parliament's draft, which critics had charged gave the president too much power and contained provisions that were rejected by the constitutional conference. Like parliament, Wako proposed a prime minister who would be appointed -- and could be dismissed -- by the president.

"",""Maina Kiai, chairman of the government-appointed Kenya National Human Rights Commission, despairs of the whole process, saying it has been hijacked by politicians who have resorted to appealing to tribal loyalties rather than debating the content of the draft charter.  "",""\""The referendum is not about the constitution ... it's about power,\"" Kiai said.  "",""The constitution rewriting process has \""completely divided us,\"" he said, adding nothing has been done to prepare to bridge divisions once the vote is over.

But Muli said the Kenya Civil Society Observation Program has received reports of voter intimidation, buying and selling of voter cards and bribery.  "",""Kibaki has been accused of trying to influence voters by announcing salary hikes for local government workers and handing over a national park to a local council in a bid to court support from the Maasai tribe. Kibaki's administration has denied those moves had anything to do with the referendum.  "",""The Kenya National Human Rights Commission has accused Cabinet ministers and other public officials of misusing government resources to campaign for or against the draft and of using hate speech or inciting their supporters to violence during rallies.  "",""Kibaki ran for president by highlighting the rival Kenya African National Union party's record of corruption and poor management during its 39 years in power. But he has allied himself to members of the party in hopes of pushing through the new constitution.  "",""Kenya's current constitution was drafted in the lead-up to independence from Britain in 1963 and has been revised several times to create a strong unitary state with sweeping presidential powers.

What is the hush about the painting of  President’s penis?"",""It could have been any person’s penis. It could even be my  fiancé’s penis. What is the whole of these arguments over Zuma’s penis? It simply means is that the penis is more superior to the vagina because vagina is common and people use it to advertise product.”"",""But more than that, a whole lot of South Africans are miffed, and so, it is not surprising that they were  mobilized  by the country’s ruling African National Congress, ANC,decked out in the black, green and gold of the party’s symbol marched about two kilometers (1.2 miles) along one of the city’s busiest roads to the gallery in the upmarket neighbourhood of Park wood, where riot police formed a barrier between them and the gallery to protest and argue for the removal of the painting from the gallery and its website."",""For these protesters numbering  about 1000, the painting, which depicts Zuma posed like Russia’s Vladimir Lenin, is noting but  offensive and derogatory of the dignity and status of Zuma as the country’s number one citizen."",""Given also the cultural differences and practices that shape South Africa’s society and moral fabrics, and of course, the antecedents of  President Zuma as a polygamist, his shown genital is been analysised by scholars  in race relation to mean an indictment on black South Africans as people without sexual control."",""The painting is believed to promote racist stereotypes of black African men and their “supposed” unbridled sexuality. The import of this painting is very controversial that  it was defaced by two vandals, an action that  was highly commended by the ANC and described as a victory."",""The saga surrounding the painting  is an indication of the level of racial  tension and xenophobia that still shape post Apartheid South Africa."",""“One should not forget that South Africa is a conservative society, despite our liberal constitution. A painting like this could offend people of all races,” said Olmo von Meijenfeldt, an analyst with the Institute for Institute for Democracy in South Africa (IDASA)."",""In a similar situation, Canadian Prime Minister , Stephen Harper was also last week the butt of a satirical artist, who  painted him nude  cracking jokes, while pundits crying foul and one federal department reportedly offer him  cash."",""According to agency report, unlike in South Africa, where Zuma’s  exposed genital has sparked off hate arguments and  race debate, the nude painting of Harper has  only generated humour."",""“In Canada, the painting of Stephen Harper has been met with some criticism, but mostly humour. Indeed, the painting, seen here and censored for the rather sensitive Canadian public, is rather funny. But it does make a real political comment.” Says our source."",""Continuing, it says , “It is a form of political commentary that has inspired debate and discussion about Harper as PM and the appropriateness of this depiction. The debate has been rather polite, if not genteel, when considering the issue (Harper’s leadership style) versus the fact that he is a weenie (sorry, will stop now).”"",""These two paradigms of artistic representations reveal a lot of things about art in Africa as an instrument of debate and healthy discourse. It also makes important statement about the freedom or rather the right of the artist to express him self."",""The way it is reported that Canadian society responds to the caricature made of their prime Minister shows the level human and creative freedom that shape the life  of Canadian society and its creative agents."",""This is unlike in Africa, where everything is subjected to race and ethnic prisms. The action, also of the ANC,  which got a court injunction to ban the country’s City Press newspaper, which covered the exhibition, and also to ban the gallery to remove all public images of the work is seen to curtail the right of creative freedom and expression.

We need a heavy reduction in cost of governance so that the traders that litter government would seek other areas to make blood money from. But no one was interested in less government at less cost."",""Some zones even prefer further strengthening of the position of governor, a position I told you we can do without and save at least 78 per cent of the cost of paying godfathers for choosing for compensation, those who lost nominations for elections. Instead of dismantling the protective wall built around those I call the 74 monarchs – the president, the vice president, the 36 governors and their 36 deputies – some were asking for more protection for them so that they are not in any way disturbed during the period they hold office."",""No one seems to be interested in the clearÂ  provision that the protection of the 74 is when they perform the functions of the office, which, you will agree, is neither corruption nor money laundering. The good news, however, is that the discussions were held in the six geo-political zones, the future federating units of a restructured Nigeria. Read that again.

It must be underlined by the need to integrate as a people who cooperate, not dominate, in the management of resourcesÂ  in the area of their habitation."",""This country is rich, endowed by God, and as I have said, God has never endowed in vain. He endows for the benefit of people, not the greed of the managers of the endowments.

We have been left behind, and today, all roads lead to India for cure of ailments, from kidney transplants to fixing broken bones."",""The structures we have would win for us a gold medal if having them was all that was needed to judge them.

But those who called it had other things in mind. They wanted to remain in office. The plan collapsed and they threw away the baby with the bathwater. What the Senate is doing now is to address issues that will extend the areas of reaping the fruits of corruption."",""For, that will be what happens when you refuse to address the great question of decongesting the political space. Instead of doing just that, we are even being asked to create more states to extend the opportunity of milking the national cow."",""We must train the Nigerian of today to make the missionary that will work for the Nigeria of tomorrow. That outing will be more smooth when we decongest the political space, reduce the expensive structures, make politics less paying, zero in on the welfare and security of the citizens and seriously avoid those things that divert our attention to fighting effects of causes we deliberately or inadvertently accommodated."",""I said then, â€œWhat the Americans are telling us are the visible signs that can destroy a vision and a mission. But while we are trying to destroy a vision through what we think we can gain today from temporary advantages, missions do get achieved in spite of the greed, in spite of the shortsightedness of those called to prepare the ground."",""And now that we know that Nigeria does not just have a future but a mission, can we not make the fulfillment a happy and joyful one by deliberately working to smoothen the path being so clearly shown to us by the quality of people being incarnated as Nigerians? You think there is accident in this wonderful creation of God? Yes, the Americans are right in their material calculations."",""No, in the cosmic ordering, they are far off the mark.

0,"For Nigeria’s tomorrow, our Judiciary needs a complete makeover","[""A people with a written Constitution incorporating a  Bill of Rights, a free judiciary  and a robust civil\nsociety should be in a position, as we are, to blame its Judiciary, at least in some sense of being an accomplice,  if such a country misgoverns, or aborts the dream of its original founders. "",""We can see this result when a judiciary indulges itself in the luxury of thinking that constitutional adjudication can be undertaken in an ideologically neutral space, unconstrained by, and isolated from the realities of its people, their history, their economic, social and political conditions as well as their aspirations, struggles and hopes. This is often the sense one gets from Nigeria’s 50th independence anniversary reflections. "",""The post-military Nigerian judiciary has often allied itself, by the types of decisions its judges formulate, with those who squander our rights to be governed responsibly and accountably; with those who subvert the manifestos of our constitution and disavow its egalitarian philosophy. Our judiciary basically neutralizes the declaration that our State social order ‘is founded on ideals of Freedom, "",""Equality and Justice. How? By the judiciary’s failure to synchronize the Constitution’s philosophy [yes, our Constitution has a social philosophy!]with theirs. By not infusing the precepts established by the Constitution into their determinations and by refusing to remain faithful to the Constitution’s directive principles. "",""Cynics argue that the Constitution itself comes short of mandating the enforcement of these idealisms when they are crossed by government, but they should remember that the Constitution insists that the Judiciary, alongside the other branches, must assume the ‘duty and responsibility’ to ‘conform to, observe and apply the provisions of this Chapter of this Constitution’. "",""This is why I think that Nigeria’s judiciary, in many ways, is partly responsible for the stultification of the Nigerian dream, and now must, in some act of atonement, be instrumental to the struggle for its redemption, or else, be declared persona non grata. At this turn, we must ask the question that Justice Kayode Eso asked long ago: The Nigerian Judiciary: What vision for the 21st Century? (Eso, Further Thoughts on Law and Jurisprudence 2003)"",""‘Is Judicial Justice becoming hostile to Social Justice?’  "",""Nigerian courts have resisted status quo change by blocking citizens’ participation in government to ensure good governance, to the point that the courts themselves were negating the Constitution’s avowed insistence that ‘the participation by the people in their government shall be ensured …’ by denying citizens standing to sue wrongdoers in power. "",""Citizens sought to stop unconstitutional diversions of public revenue, but were stonewalled by courts. Citizens sought to make public officials account for public funds as well as recovered monies, but were resisted by the courts. Citizens sought to compel government to pay salaries of public servants that were many months in arrears, but courts said they did not have locus to do so; citizens sought more equitable ethnic distribution of public offices, but again were rebuffed by the courts."",""However, there are distinguished exceptions to this chequered portrait. In the times of military despotism and absolutism, the Nigerian Judiciary stood up, many a time, to be counted as we saw in in Lakanmi v. A.G. (West), Governor of Lagos State v. Ojukwu, (INEC v. Musa), (AG Abia v. AG Federation, Attorney General Federation v. Abubaka, Obi v. INEC.  "",""Yet, our Judiciary has not reproduced these lines consistently, and across board, particularly for the small litigant, the social or economic underdog. A student who had gained admission to a University (and was to graduate) on the basis of school certificate examinations was told later that the examinations were cancelled because of examination malpractices he had not been personally accused of, or heard from, in defence. The Supreme Court questioned the procedure by which the applicant came to court, and struck out the suit (WAEC v. Akinkumi). "",""In striking out the case, the Supreme Court did not get into the merits of the case. "",""It merely said the procedure by which Akinkumi came to court was wrong! This student spent five years in the University before he found that his results were withheld. From the time he instituted the suit in the high court of Lagos State in 1999, to the time the Supreme Court determined the case in 2008 was another nine years! After fourteen years, Candidate Akinkumi would need to begin the case afresh, or else begin his life afresh. "",""Should we, at this turn of time, saddle ourselves with a jurisprudence of exclusion attired in garments of legalese? Could the Supreme Court have found-or indeed, was it under a moral obligation if it could not find a legal one – to hear that case on its merits, in view of our Constitution’s directive to guarantee ‘easy accessibility’ to courts of law [section 17(2)(e)? "",""Beyond the law: Other Blots on the Landscape "",""Therefore, while the challenge before our Judicature includes rendering fearless decisions, it also transcends it and extends to ‘finding ‘turn around’ situations in the political economy for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups’, to borrow from fomer Indian Chief Justice, P.N. Bhagwati. Has the Nigerian judiciary tried to ‘wipe the tear from every [Nigeiran] eye’ that has endured decades of exploitation, degradation and alienation? Has the judiciary redrawn its protocols of access and rules of procedure to ensure that people of this class can seek to be relieved of their denials and oppression in the shortest possible time at the lowest possible cost through the intermediation of courts of law? "",""Can court rules which require equal filing fees between multinational corporations suing to enforce contracts the size of national budgets and rural farmowners dispossessed of their lands by affluent land speculators make sense? Why should it be just to judicial administrators that a suffering widow should abandon her claim for redress over a company’s negligence that has caused the death of her husband because she cannot raise exorbitant filing fees? "",""Why should it make sense to us that a Judge can grant an injunction to prevent corruption agencies from arresting alleged looters and cannot grant an injunction to stop the demolition of houses in land the government wishes to parcel out to developers?"",""Docket Congestion\nHow has the judiciary dealt with trial delays from docket congestions that tax the patience of every court user, litigant and lawyer alike, and disincentivizes the desire for redress? Has our judiciary undertaken some introspection and said, as a matter of policy, every federal and state judiciary must integrate ICT to create better efficiencies in the use of time, reduce costs, labour and other processual waste in the judicial system? Why do our judges use nineteenth century infrastructure and expect to meet the challenges of the 21st century?\nNeedless Adjournments"",""Have not people traveled from different ends of our country to attend court dates only to be told on the scheduled dates that the judge has not arrived from a journey overseas? Does the judiciary undertake to reimburse the costs of these needless journeys and provide covers for the travel risks associated with them also? Where is the evidence that the Judiciary actually cares about how its work is perceived by the consumers of its services?"",""Questions of Integrity and Independence\nFifty years after, how have our courts observed the constitutional directive that the ‘independence, impartiality and integrity of courts of law and easy accessibility thereto shall be secured and maintained’? Our judiciary has endured the ridicule of many corruption scandals, yet tries to keep a straight face. Respectable voices have warned that corruption has eaten too deep into its soul, yet our Judiciary is happy to be called the least corrupt branch. The National Judicial Council, the judicial ethics watchdog’s work has sometimes been useful, but too often politicized. "",""Leaving that aside, what about perceptions of independence? A Chief Judge of one of our States announced publicly that a novelty football match between the State High Court Judges and the members of the Legislative branch of the State will be played as part of activities commemorating the start of the new legal year! In days gone by, no one would probably think of such a fun-fare gathering of politicians and ‘justicians’. While in office, judicial officers often isolate themselves from the social marketplace, to sustain the idea of their independence. If our judges need to produce some entertainment, why not play this coveted game amongst themselves? "",""The State where this event will take place retains over fifty judges and their number can deliver four or five football teams, which they can name after such greats as Chelsea, Barcelona, or Inter Milan if they like. Or, even, to be patroitic, after Eyimba, Kwara United or Julius Berger. They can even choose to play against Court of Appeal Judges in the State, or even retired Judges. Why court the fellowship of those over whose cases you preside so often? What good will it do to the Judiciary’s image perception? Why eat into the little capital that’s left to the judiciary’s reputation. "",""Fifty years after, has the Judiciary insured that its bureaucracy is efficient and its environment largely corruption-ree? After litigants pay all the official filing and service of process fees, why do they still need to ‘negotiate and pay’ ‘fees’ to court bailiffs to ensure their processes are served, which is a repetition of payments for services the judiciary has already undertaken to perform? "",""Does the Judiciary not close its eyes to its own weaknesses and hold others responsible for its own failings? Does the Judiciary not realize that the hapless court user will ultimately be unfairly taxed and burdened with the costs of the courts inefficient bureaucracy? Who should clean up and straighten the Judiciary in this regard? The Attorney General, or the legislature, or perhaps even the lawyers?  "",""How about using the law to relieve those who suffer the loss of their liberty and dignity, and sometimes are in the ‘shadows of death’ at the hands of torturers in law enforcement centres? Why do many of these people opt to settle their cases at police stations, negotiating bail money with gluttonous law enforcers than come to court to find reprieve? Is help from courts in urgent situations involving the downtrodden often not a hopeless dream when it takes sometimes weeks to assign a fundamental rights enforcement application to a judge for hearing? "",""Have courts not dismissed fundamental rights actions because one technical rule was not religiously complied with, and refused to give justice to beleaguered claimants? Where is the sensitivity of our Judiciary to our socio-economic state of being, a reference so urged by the Nigerian Supreme Court in Ariori v. Elemo?"","" The same kind of spirit that has led the Indian Judiciary to re-create rules of standing to open up a new access to court route it calls ‘epistolary jurisdiction’ for the benefit of indigent folk? Even the holy book charges ‘Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.’ Psalm 82:3. For again, though the courts must take ‘rights seriously’, it has a higher responsibility, as constitutional scholar Upendra Baxi posits, to take ‘suffering seriously’.  "",""Conclusion"",""Nigeria has largely squandered the bright promises of its independence, and bad governance has left a majority of Nigerians impoverished, despoiled, despondent and angry. 92% of Nigerians, the statistics say, live on less than $2 a day. Nigeria has the highest income disparity rate globally and a few days ago, the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency Dr. Muhammad Ali Pate, revealed that Nigeria, again, has the worst maternal, newborn and child mortality rate in the world with an estimated 52,900 women and 250,000 newborn babies dying yearly from causes that are largely preventable. "",""Yet, our judiciary has largely remained agnostic and indifferent to these conditions, looked the other way while Nigeria was being plundered and defiled, and in some cases, kept keen watch for those defiling her. A once proud, respectable Judiciary has shaken off its dignity and prestige by alienating itself from its own people. "",""Our judiciary needs to awaken to newer realities of its institutional and instrumental role in nation building, and accept the moral responsibility that comes with the knowledge that its own actions or omissions, its ideology or want of it, its own strength or weakness, can keep Nigeria long enough in the doldrums to ignite forces of radical or even violent change, or create the juristic conditions for peaceful and ordered change. "",""The life of the law, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the American Supreme Court said long ago, has not been logic, but experience. If law is found only in logic, we should then join the graveside chorus, which our judicial brethren must take pride in,  ‘justice is dead, long live the law’. "",""There is still time to shape a new direction for the Nigerian judiciary and the Chief Justice of Nigeria needs to provide leadership to set a new order for things; we need to tear down a number of juridical concepts, and build new ones. We need to confront heady obstructions, and straigthen crooked paths. "",""We need to do the hard-work to make things work, and not keep our heads buried in the sand. We need to confront our convenient pretences, and accept inconvenient truths. Justice Katsina Alu has enough time to begin the process of rebuilding, perhaps not enough to complete it, but whatever he does now will be credited to his legacy. When the coming generation looks again at the Nigerian judiciary fifty years from now, let them write a different story. Let them say the Judiciary has won back the friendship and the respect of the Nigerian people. ""]",vanguardngr.com/2010/10/for-nigeria%e2%80%99s-tomorrow-our-judiciary-needs-a-complete-makeover-2

The current constitution will remain in force.

The campaign was rarely about the provisions of the draft charter -- whether the prime minister it proposed would have enough independence or whether enough powers were being devolved from the long-dominant central government to local administrations.  "",""Instead, Kenyans were asked to consider whether Kibaki had kept promises he made during his 2002 presidential campaign to foster democracy and accountability and root out the corruption that had become endemic under the 24-year rule of his predecessor, President Daniel arap Moi.  "",""Kibaki had pledged in October 2002 that if he became president he would ensure Kenya got a new constitution within his first 100 days. Since winning the presidency, he has repeatedly faced charges his government was reluctant to adopt a new charter unless it satisfied the interests of those in power.  "",""In the first year of his presidency, Kibaki was applauded for going after politicians associated with corruption. But those politicians were linked to the Moi regime. In his second year in office, when the focus turned to corruption in high places in his own administration, Kibaki stumbled, many Kenyans believe.

Critics said Kibaki, like Moi, wanted absolute power.  "",""The defeat of the proposed constitution \""shows that the future of the country lies not in an imperial presidency, but in accountable leadership,\"" said Uhuru Kenyatta, who led the campaign opposing the new constitution.  "",""Kenya's current constitution, drawn up in the lead-up to Kenya's 1963 independence from Britain, has been revised several times to create a strong unitary state in which the president has sweeping powers.

An independent judiciary would also be formed."",""“If the Arab Spring is to be credited with anything, it is that it helped us realize we should not slow the pace of reform,” said Ahmed Herzenni, a former political prisoner and now an ally of the king, who helped to write the referendum. “I feel like we are on the eve of a second independence.”"",""Sweltering heat kept most voters away from polling stations — about 40,000 of them across the relatively stable kingdom in the northwestern corner of Africa — early in the day, though voting picked up later.

The king, who is 47 and has been in power since 1999, is widely considered to be a less rigid ruler than his father, King Hassan II."",""The referendum was seen by many as a pre-emptive measure against the widespread protests and unrest in other Arab countries, and as a recognition of the demands and expectations of Moroccans no longer satisfied to be ruled from above."",""Among its provisions, the constitutional revisions would make Berber — a minority language in Morocco — an official language alongside Arabic, and would explicitly grant the government executive powers. Government ministers, ambassadors and provincial governors would be appointed by the prime minister, though still subject to the approval of the king."",""Despite some criticism of the reforms as window dressing, many Moroccans saw the referendum as a positive step. “This is just a beginning,” a voter who identified himself only as Mehdi said at a polling station in Casablanca. “I hope that parties will be mature enough and come up with solid political and social-economical programs.”""]",nytimes.com/2011/07/02/world/africa/02morocco

0,OTANI: Why Uhuru must block Raila’s referendum bid at all costs,"[""Kenyans on 21 November 2005 rejected a proposed constitution in a divisive national referendum that saw the then President Mwai Kibaki humiliated after 58 per cent of Kenyans rejected the draft."",""This was despite Kibaki leading the Yes vote campaign backed by many government officials."",""The No vote was backed by the Orange Democratic Movement that brought together then Roads minister Raila Odinga, Uhuru Kenyatta (now President), William Ruto (now Deputy President), Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi, Joe Nyagah and Najib Balala who campaigned against the proposed constitution."",""The Yes team was given the symbol of a banana by the now defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya, while the No team received an orange symbol, and this gave birth to the current ODM party."",""The constitutional referendum split the then ruling National Rainbow Coalition into camps setting the teams on a heated collision during countrywide campaigns for and against the draft constitution that ran over several months, resulting in nine people losing their lives."",""President Kibaki was then accused of trying to amass more powers to become dictatorial, with his opponents rooting for power-sharing between the President and a Prime Minister, even as the final draft taken to the vote retained sweeping powers for the Head of State."",""Flash-forward, President Uhuru Kenyatta now faces a similar quandary as Kibaki did in 2005, with opposition CORD principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetangula trying to squeeze in a referendum to amend the constitution, arguing it will okoa (save) Kenyans and better their lives."",""Among the issues Railas brigade wants addressed, through the Okoa Kenya Referendum Bill, are the disbandment of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, increased funding for counties, devolution of security, making the anti-graft agency EACC a constitutional commission as well as poll, institutional and land sector reforms."",""Okoas opponents may argue the plebiscite is dead in the water, especially after IEBC rejected the bid through a verdict that CORD fell short of the 1 million signatures required by law to back the vote and only managed to garner 891,598 signatures of validly registered voters."",""However, CORD seems to be spoiling for a fight with President Kenyattas Jubilee government and IEBC combined, in what promises to be a bruising battle ahead of the 2017 general election, in which he is seeking a second term with his deputy William Ruto by his hip."",""Before the rejection of the signatures by the poll body, Raila, Kalonzo and Wetangula were relying on IEBC approving their referendum push to start a whirlwind akin to the 2005 one that resulted in a hotly-contested bungled presidential election that nearly saw Raila kick out the incumbent Kibaki from State House, resulting in the worst post election violence the country has ever witnessed."",""Claims by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale backed by TNA Chairman Johnson Sakaja that the Okoa signatures were fake have only fuelled oppositions suspicions about the poll bodys autonomy and they accuse it of working with the government to frustrate their referendum bid."",""Now this situation poses a grave danger to President Kenyattas administration, with the election only seventeen months away. If CORD can regain its composure and revive its bid through collecting fresh signatures to meet the legal threshold, Kenyatta will have to deal with a CORD tornado through campaigns for the referendum close to the election and this will divert him from trying to implement his key pledges, most which are belated and have been beleaguered by corruption scandals."",""Given the pressure the president already faces due to rampant corruption that is spiraling out of control, numerous pledges that remain unrealized, accusations of gradually eroding democratic gains through various pieces of legislations to empower the presidency, allegations of awarding cronies and favoring the two major tribes in appointments, a deputy president who is facing a growing revolt in his Rift Valley political backyard and a population that is continually growing skeptical, he has no room to entertain a national vote campaign that will focus the spotlight on his many weak spots."",""A referendum will leave him too exposed and distracted, given his key point men like Aden Duale and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen have been slowed down by graft claims after they were mentioned as alleged beneficiaries of the Ksh 791 million tender scandal at the National Youth Service by the former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru, allegations that they have vehemently denied."",""Kenyatta is also grappling with an internal revolt against the planned dissolution of Jubilee Coalition for parties to join the new Jubilee Party that he intends to exploit to seek a second tenure. This also comes after his Jubilee aspirant Philip Charo lost the Malindi parliamentary by-election to ODMs Willy Mtengo despite a spirited campaign, as DP Ruto also faced an onslaught from independence party KANU and rebel jubilee leaders like Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto that exposed his nakedness."",""Referendum-type campaigns are Railas forte, this will mean the Head of State will have to marshal his troops to ward off the bare-knuckle jabs the former Prime Minister will be throwing and this means he will have to divert all his energy, resources, time and focus to ensure the plebiscite flops, so he will not have time to deliver on his pledges on time to use them to seek re-election next year."",""The only option President Uhuru Kenyatta has is to ensure the referendum doesnt happen during his first or second tenures, by all means necessary, and this means he must employ the best advisors on constitutional, political, propaganda, social media and image matters to be able to block the probable murky, tumultuous, shark-infested waters that Raila threatens to flood his administration with.""]",citizentv.co.ke/indexp=119633

0,Constitutional amendment requires no presidential assent,"[""The controversy whether or not the amended constitution by the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria requires presidential assent is an academic exercise. This is because presidential assent to constitutional amendment is superfluous, unnecessary and not required by the provisions of Section 9 of the 1999 Constitution."",""What the amendment requires to become effective or operational is for the amendment to beÂ  supported by two-thirds majority of members of the National assembly and approved by not less than two-thirds majority of all the members of the state legislatures. For avoidance of doubt,Â  Section 9Â  of the Constitution states as follows: (1)Â  The National Assembly may, subject to the provisions of this section, alter any of the provisions of this Constitution;"",""(2)Â Â  Any act of the National Assembly for the alteration of this constitution, not being an Act to which section 8 of this constitution applies, shall not be passed in either House of the National Assembly unless the proposal is supported by the votes of not less than two-thirds majority of all the members of that House and approved by resolution of the Houses of Assembly of not less than two-thirds of all the States;"",""(3)Â Â  An Act of the National assembly for the purpose of altering the provisions of this section, section 8m andÂ  Chapter IV of this constitution shall not be passed by either House of the National Assembly unless the proposal is approved by the votes ofÂ  not less than four_fifths majority of all the members of each House and also approved byÂ  resolution of the Houses of Assembly of not less than two-thirds of all the states."",""The effect of this is that in the case of any alteration to the fundamental human rights provisions in Chapter IV of the constitution, what is required is four-fifths majority of all the members of each House and also approved by resolution of the Houses of Assembly of not less than two-thirds of all the states. Therefore, any amendment to alter the fundamental human rights provision of the Constitution must be supported by not less than four-fifth of members of the National assembly. This provision is to underscore the importance the framers of the constitution gave to the fundamental human rights provision in Chapter IV of the Constitution."",""Be that as it may, what makes the amendment effective is not the resolution or approval of the National Assembly per se but final ratification or approval of the same by Two-thirds majority of the State legislatures presumably in the name of â€œThe Peopleâ€. What the National Assembly therefore does is actually to approve the proposal forÂ  the amendments and send the approved proposalsÂ  to the state legislatures for approval."",""Once the National Assembly receives the required approval of the State legislatures, it then sets a timetable for the effective date and commencement of the new constitution. This process of ratification is what is contained in section 9 of the 1999 Constitution and no other meanings should be read into it. The reason is simple, what would happen if the president refuses his assent after being approved by the National Assembly and ratified or approved by the State legislatures as provided for under Section 9 of the Constitution? Can the president veto it because he has the power of veto? The answer is No. Presentation of the amendment constitution to the President for assent is unsupported by law and may constitute an infraction of the constitution itself. It should not be contemplated at all."",""Legally speaking, constitutional amendment is not treated like an ordinary bill; it is an extra-ordinary act of National Assembly in form of an approved proposal or recommendation from the National Assembly to the State legislatures for approval. It is not the approval of the National Assembly alone that gives it the force of law but the contemporaneous approval by the State legislatures. It is therefore, superfluous and surplus to constitutional requirement in section 9 of the 1999 Constitution to have the assent of the President before the amendments can become effective. In the same manner, the president can neither sign nor veto any amendments to the constitution."",""The drafters of the 1999 Constitution knew that at some point, it would be necessary for the constitution to be amended particularly since the constitution was not a product of the people. Nonetheless, they were also determined to make such changes difficult to achieve so as not to turn the constitution into a cheap and ill-conceived document while at the same time maintaining a delicate balance for amendment in order not to unduly frustrate the wish of the people; hence, the requirements in section 9 of the 1999 Constitution. If the framers wanted a presidential assent, they would have unequivocally stated that in the Constitution and would not be a subject of legal debate."",""The United States Constitution is the oldest written Constitution in the world today and it has undergone 27 amendments to date. In all of this, regardless of how the amendments were proposed by the Congress, they were only ratified by Three-fourth of the State legislatures for them to become effective. There are also no records to indicate that any of the amendments was signed by the president before becoming operational. Rather, what is written in the US Constitution is the date each amendment was ratified."",""It is also instructive to note that an amendment to the United States constitution may be done in three ways namely: The new amendment may be approved by two-thirds of both houses of Congress, then sent to the state legislatures for approval, Two-thirds of the state legislatures may apply to Congress for a Constitutional Convention to consider amendments, which are then sent to the states for approval and finally, Congress may require ratification by special Convention. The convention method has been used only once, to approve the 21st Amendment repealing prohibition, (1933). Regardless of the method of proposing an amendment, final ratification requires approval by three-fourths of the states and no consent or signature of the president is necessary."",""In conclusion, the only method for amending the 1999 constitution is as prescribed in Section 9 of the Constitution. And that being the case, the approval of the Two-thirds of the state legislatures is what is needed to ratify the amendment. What is therefore, left is for the National Assembly to set the effective date of commencement of the new constitution without any further delay.""]",vanguardngr.com/2010/08/constitutional-amendment-requires-no-presidential-assent

Cyriakus Njoku, a member of the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP), brought the case."",""But Justice Mudashiru Oniyangi of the High Court in Abuja rejected that argument."",""“After the death of Umar Yar’Adua, there was no election.
