But opponents accuse him of increasingly undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech.     Magufuli has publicly denied the allegations, saying he is no dictator. But several newspapers have been shut and more than a dozen suspects prosecuted for allegedly insulting the president via WhatsApp and other social media platforms."",""The CCM won 42 of 43 local government elections in November, prompting the main opposition parties to announce a boycott of several parliamentary by-elections early next year, citing foul play. Smaller opposition parties will participate in the polls.     Tanzania, one of sub-Saharan Africa’s most stable democracies, has held five relatively peaceful multi-party elections since 1995, all won by the CCM.""]",reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-politics/tanzania-threatens-to-de-register-churches-who-rap-president-from-pulpit-idUSKBN1EN0WW,28-12-17 19:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""ARG0"":[""Tanzania"",[0]],""V"":[""threatens"",[1]],""ARG1"":[""to de - register churches who rap president from pulpit"",[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""ARG0"":[""a cleric"",[18,19]],""V"":[""criticized"",[20]],""ARG1"":[""President John Magufuli ’s leadership"",[21,22,23,24,25]],""ARGM-LOC"":[""in a Christmas sermon"",[26,27,28,29]]}",,"{""ARG0"":[""Tanzania"",[0]],""V"":[""threatened"",[2]],""ARG1"":[""to revoke the registration of religious organizations that “ mix religion and politics ”"",[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]],""ARGM-TMP"":[""after a cleric criticized President John Magufuli ’s leadership in a Christmas sermon"",[17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]]}",,

We consistently occupied the Amnesty International for the seven-day period irrespective of the intense blackmail and propaganda directed at us by the NGO."",""In the course of the seven days, over two million protestors took part in the anti-Amnesty International protests in Lagos and more than one million participated in Abuja under rain, sun and unwarranted brutality from Amnesty International."",""The occupation has been illuminating for us because it surfaced a lot of facts and useful information that were hitherto in the realm of conjecture."",""For one, we have been able to establish that the conspiracy against the existence of Nigeria is more extensive and elaborate than previously thought. While Amnesty International is the arrowhead of the foreign component of this evil agenda, it has a large network of other NGOs, CSOs and even quasi-business entities that are running errands for it – these are the groups that jointly issued statements to condemn the occupation of Amnesty International’s office. Individuals that are on its payroll equally exposed themselves as such by condemning our action."",""The extent of Amnesty International’s infiltration of Nigeria is alarming to a point where it even has the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on a leash like a dog. It launched NHRC like an attack dog against this protest in an act of desperation forgetting that it has exposed the lapses at the Commission in terms of playing its own role of monitoring issues of human rights in Nigeria. We now understand that NHRC deliberately abandoned its duties to create a vacuum for Amnesty International to exploit. Our protest exposed this unholy alliance, which forced NHRC to tediously attempt to disparage our efforts."",""Not to be left out are members of the opposition. The people that contracted Amnesty International to run local side shows for them in the course of implementing its internationally hatched destabilization agenda. They owned and tele-guide the proscribed organizations like IMN and IPOB as well as anarchist movements like RevolutionNow and DaysofRage, which have been deployed to cause widespread violence. Even as we occupied its offices, the NGO continued to defend the rights of these groups to destroy Nigeria without being challenged or prevented from doing so. It defended their incitement and call to violence as “freedom of speech”."",""For those that ever doubted that Amnesty International is interested in plunging into war, its sponsorship of the fake revolution by the proscribed and anarchist movements against the democratically elected Federal Government led by President Muhammadu Buhari is a final proof that should jolt all patriotic citizens into action. We should be alarmed that upon being found out as a subversive organization, instead of giving up its destabilization agenda, Amnesty International has rather intensified its attack on the Nigerian state while urging that inciting and hate speech should be allowed as “freedom of expression”."",""This strategy had served the NGO in other countries that are today in disarray and it is to our collective peril to allow it replicate same successfully in Nigeria."",""It is instructive that Amnesty International and its allies have condemned our occupation of its offices while decrying our call for more Nigerians to join the protests against its subversive activities while defending the rights of anarchist movements to do exactly the same thing and even worse against the Nigerian state and its government."",""The implication is that the NGO is not willing to accept the treatment it is encouraging its clients to give the federal government. It is clear that this organization knows that the people it is supporting are doing the wrong thing but it is defending them simply because it wants to get at the government and weaken it."",""It was discovered that the protests being backed by Amnesty International are a fallback position after its support for Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) did not translate into an ability to penetrate metropolitan cities and carry out attacks against places of interests. An option to use violent protests by IMN and IPOB similarly failed."",""But we have also learnt that this NGO has no desire of giving up on its destabilization agenda as it will always plot new schemes to achieve its goals whenever its strategy is defeated."",""This is why we have resolved that Amnesty International must leave Nigeria now. We stood up, as a coalition of several groups, to challenge its subversive activities in the last seven days. We expect that this organization will use the benefit of the end of the seven days occupation to slink away at night because criminals are accustomed to making their getaway under the cover of darkness."",""But where we discover that the NGO continues to violate the space of Nigeria by remaining in the country after these seven days of occupation, we want to categorically warn that the various groups may be forced to return on Monday, this time for a round 40 of days of occupation."",""If we are pushed to begin the 40 days occupation, our member will make a daily advance of one metre upon the premises of Amnesty International until we enter its reception, workstations, conference room and offices to bodily throw out its staffers and escort them to the airport. The 40 days will witness impassioned Nigerians overrunning this Office with their properties to permanently occupy the place until the needful is done."",""Vanguard""]",vanguardngr.com/2019/08/ai-protesters-threaten-to-embark-on-40-day-civil-disobedience,07-08-19 20:00,Nigeria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""ARG0"":[""The Coalition for Civil Rights and Good Governance"",[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]],""V"":[""threatened"",[9]],""ARG1"":[""to embark on “ 40 days civil disobedience ” over the refusal of Amnesty International ( AI ) to leave the shores of Nigeria"",[10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33]]}",,

430226,Is Buhari on top of national security?,"[""President Muhammadu Buharis body language and promises to respond forcefully to widespread abductions and murder of citizens by herdsmen have been less than convincing. In public and private domains, he has acted like a man lost for direction at a major road intersection. It is either he is overwhelmed by national security challenges or he is pretending to be unaware of the destruction that herdsmen have caused across the country. Whichever might be the case, Buhari needs national and international assistance and he needs it urgently."",""Prior to Buharis emergence as President, the herdsmen did not constitute a major national security threat. Many people have suggested that the callous and audacious activities of herdsman were informed by the herdsmens awareness that they were protected by their kinsmen in the Presidency, who would never take action to check their provocative acts of lawlessness. Thats not surprising. When you have relatives in high places, you treat the law as an ass. Suddenly, the private business interests of cattle breeders from a geographic region of the country have become governments priority concern. All of a sudden, cattle breeders have become a strong force in national politics."",""The contradictions that govern our national life can never be under-estimated. While other countries are investing in science and technology to boost national development and to improve the socioeconomic conditions of their citizens, our government is looking for ways to set up cattle colonies to enhance the welfare of cattle breeders from the North. Is that progressive thinking or a backward way of holding a country down? When do private business interests become government business?"",""In 2015, Buhari pledged that he would govern in the interest of all Nigerians. However, over the past four years and more, we have seen him enact policies and take decisions that demonstrate he is far more interested in promoting the wellbeing of people in his region of the country. It is this skewed policy of governance that explains why the President has been apathetic to violence and killings that take place in the South-East, South-West, Middle Belt, and South-South regions of the country. If Buhari claims he is well and truly on top of national security challenges, the situation on the ground does not support that claim."",""How did Nigeria, a country that used to serve as a reference point in the world, suddenly lose its appeal? How did we plunge so rapidly into the bottom of the ravine so much so that even small and impoverished countries that used to rely on our financial assistance now take pride in poking their fingers into our eyes? We can only reminisce about that glorious past because our present image has been shredded."",""It is not that we do not know that Nigeria is descending into a deep hole. The trouble is the government doesnt know how to stop the rapid descent into the bottom of the valley. It is perhaps for this reason, the lack of effective leadership, the widespread corruption, growing insecurity and the ongoing slide toward anarchy that the former Speaker of the House of Representatives and current governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, suggested on Tuesday, July 2, 2013, that Nigeria was due for a revolution."",""At a lecture he delivered as a guest of the Nigerian Institute of Management, Tambuwal said: The most compelling reasons for revolution throughout the ages were injustice, crushing poverty, marginalisation, rampant corruption, lawlessness, joblessness, and general disaffection with the ruling elite."",""All these, you would agree, are now prevalent in Nigeria."",""The call for a revolution suggests to me that Nigeria has reached a blind alley through which the country can make no further progress. But it is important to point out there is something foggy, perilous, and unpredictable about a revolution. Revolutions do not usually end the way they were planned by organisers. Things can get out of hand. A revolution that strays off track can spawn political and social instability. It can produce more chaos than social order. It can weaken rather than produce the energy required to advance the nation. If you are in doubt, ask Egyptians about their experiences since the 2011 Arab uprisings."",""If you believe that things have to get worse in Nigeria before they get better, perhaps a revolution might serve that purpose. Hopefully, when the flames from the revolution have eased, a new Nigeria will emerge from the ashes. It will be a Nigeria in which political leaders will be more accountable to the people. It will be a new Nigeria in which citizens will be freer to scrutinise political leaders. It will be a new Nigeria in which the institutions of society will operate effectively and productively."",""Let us get this point clear. Rampaging herdsmen are sowing the seeds of revolution and instability in Nigeria. Unfortunately, this is happening in full view of a government that has remained silent. Effective governance is not about protecting and advancing the interests of people in one part of the country. Governance is not about promoting the happiness of political leaders kith and kin. Governance is not about overlooking people whose religious principles or doctrines you do not share or believe in. Governance is not about marginalising members of other ethnic groups. Indeed, governance is not about giving high fives to members of your clan. To do so is to promote a narrow-minded and prejudiced policy of maladministration."",""Nigeria is facing the possibility of a Yugoslavia-type breakup and bloody revolution. That is the greatest challenge that confronts all of us, particularly if the government continues to play the three monkeys that choose to see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil. It is a dreadful but probable scenario."",""It is not only the government that must be held accountable for the imminent collapse of the country. Members of the National Assembly are equally blameworthy. They have been untroubled by the senseless murders that are occurring in various parts of the country. They must have been infected by the same virus of nonchalance that has gripped the Presidency. Everywhere you go, you will observe an upsurge in the body count of victims of herdsmens cold-hearted killings. It is a shame that we have a nonchalant National Assembly whose members are preoccupied with the pursuit of their selfish interests rather than the pursuit of the interests of citizens."",""The situation in the country is dire. Human life has no value anymore. You go out in the morning and you are not sure whether you will return home alive or kidnapped by herdsmen. In various communities, people are gripped by fear of herdsmen. Citizens retire at night but are unsure whether they would be butchered while at sleep. In many neighbourhoods, men and women have turned to vigilantism. They cannot trust the police to protect them and their property."",""What the nation needs is an immediate end to the pogrom in the Middle Belt, and an end to the senseless destruction of lives in the South-East, South-South, and South-West regions by herdsmen. A radical approach by government is required to reassure everyone that the Presidency does not condone murderers in any way."",""All this is wishful thinking. I dont expect Buhari to act now or in the future to end violence by herdsmen.

Is INEC’s assurance that from their own projections and past experience across the country the failure rate of card readers is only one or two per cent? What is the basis for only making allowances for only 4,000? Is this based on past experience?"",""“Mr President, why we need concrete answers to all these questions is that, in the absence of incident forms, should there be more card readers failing over and above 4,000?  What is INEC’s contingency plans to deal with that?"",""“We don’t want staggered elections. We want nationwide elections, same time, same day all over the country. So, INEC needs to brief us on the basis of this small addition."",""“I think it is a matter of commonsense that, every card reader should have a spare.

The one meant for Delta State, were delivered to Edo State. This is not a weather issue, it is not… I don’t know how to explain that. This mix-up is not about not being able to lift materials. It is about lifting materials to wrong areas."",""“Having been a victim of election rigging, we know that one of the things INEC had done before was to deliberately carry one voter’s register from one LG to another.

Section 33 of the Constitution preserves the right to life. Ballot box snatching is not a capital offense in Nigeria at present. Whatever happens, we must follow the laws of our land."",""“The Electoral Act prescribes two year jail term for ballot box snatchers, that is after trial.
