327870,"Mugabe Rival Quits Zimbabwe Runoff, Citing Attacks","[""JOHANNESBURG — The leader of Zimbabwe’s opposition party withdrew Sunday from a presidential runoff, just five days before it was to be held, saying he could neither participate “in this violent, illegitimate sham of an election process,” nor ask his voters to risk their lives in the face of threats from forces backing President Robert Mugabe."",""The opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, the standard-bearer of the Movement for Democratic Change, said at a news conference in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, that his party was facing a war rather than an election, “and we will not be part of that war.”"",""A governing party militia blocked his supporters from attending a major rally in Harare on Sunday, the head of an election observer team said. The opposition said rowdy youths, armed with iron bars and sticks, beat up people who had come to cheer for Mr. Tsvangirai."",""It was the latest incident in a tumultuous campaign season in which Mr. Tsvangirai has been repeatedly detained, his party’s chief strategist jailed on treason charges that many people consider bogus, and rampant state-sponsored violence has left at least 85 opposition supporters dead and thousands injured, according to tallies by doctors treating the victims."",""Mr. Tsvangirai’s decision to quit the race seems intended to force Zimbabwe’s neighbors to take a stand. There are growing cracks in the solidarity that African heads of state have shown for Mr. Mugabe, an 84-year-old liberation hero whose defiant anti-Western rhetoric has long struck a resonant chord in a region with a bitter colonial history."",""The United States and Britain are pressing to put Zimbabwe’s political crisis on the United Nations Security Council agenda on Monday, a step South Africa, the region’s most powerful nation, has consistently opposed."",""Gordon D. Johndroe, the White House National Security Council spokesman, said in an e-mail message that the United States wants the United Nations to consider taking additional steps. “Mugabe cannot be allowed to repress the Zimbabwean people forever,” he said."",""It remains to be seen whether southern Africa’s leaders will collectively censure Mr. Mugabe or take tougher steps, such as economic sanctions, to isolate his government. They have never done so before, despite elections in 2002 and 2005 that were widely believed to have been marked by rigging and fraud, but that his regional peers declared legitimate."",""Marwick Khumalo, who heads the Pan-African Parliament’s observer team, which witnessed the aborted rally on Sunday, said it would be unfortunate if bodies representing African nations endorsed the current election. He said he had just returned from the Rusape District in Manicaland Province where the police chief told him six people, all from the opposition, had been killed."",""“How can you have an election where people are killed and hacked to death as the sun goes down?” Mr. Khumalo asked. “How can you have an election where the leader of one party is not even allowed to conduct rallies?”"",""Nonetheless, Zimbabwe’s information minister, Sikhanyiso Ndlovu, told The Associated Press that the runoff would go forward on Friday despite Mr. Tsvangirai’s departure from the race."",""“The Constitution does not say that if somebody drops out or decides to chicken out the runoff will not be held,” Mr. Ndlovu said."",""Mr. Tsvangirai notified the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, the regional mediator in Zimbabwe’s crisis, of his withdrawal, Mr. Mbeki’s spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, said, adding that Mr. Mbeki was encouraged that the candidate “is not closing the door on negotiations completely.” Mr. Ratshitanga declined to comment on the legitimacy of the current election."",""There may yet be more twists in this saga. Zambia’s president, Levy Mwanawasa, a Mugabe critic and the chairman of the Southern African Development Community, the bloc of 14 nations that chose Mr. Mbeki as mediator, suggested to reporters in Lusaka, Zambia, that the election should be postponed “to avert a catastrophe in the region.”"",""And Mr. Tsvangirai kept open the possibility that he might re-enter the race in the extremely unlikely event that the United Nations or the African Union stepped in to end the violence by Wednesday, when he intends to announce his party’s next steps."",""Mr. Mugabe, in power for 28 years, has made it difficult for his fellow African heads of state to pretend there is anything normal about this election. He has repeatedly declared at public rallies in recent days that he would never allow Mr. Tsvangirai, whom he denounces as a pawn of Britain, the former colonial power in Zimbabwe, to become president through the ballot box, vowing that the bullet is mightier than the ballpoint pen."",""“Only God, who appointed me, will remove me, not the M.D.C., not the British,” Mr. Mugabe declared in the city of Bulawayo on Friday. “Only God will remove me!”"",""Mr. Tsvangirai defeated Mr. Mugabe in a general election on March 29 by 48 percent to 43 percent, according to the government’s count. The opposition claimed it had won a majority outright and that no runoff was needed."",""The Movement for Democratic Change has a history of agonizing about whether to participate in elections it presumed would be unfair, and there have long been deep divisions within the party about how to proceed. This year, Mr. Tsvangirai reluctantly entered the race, though he argued that Mr. Mbeki, the mediator, had failed to ensure conditions for a fair contest."",""Mr. Tsvangirai said earlier this year that, at a minimum, the election would reveal the ugly face of Mr. Mugabe’s despotic and economically disastrous reign. The opposition then vacillated about participating in the June 27 runoff, but finally decided to do so."",""Opposition party leaders assumed that the ferocious violence against its supporters would abate once election observers from across Africa arrived, making it possible for them to campaign openly and mobilize their poll workers. Instead, Mr. Khumalo, the head of the team of election observers, said, “As the election was gaining momentum, so was the violence.”"",""In a decision that will be likely to disappoint some of his supporters, especially those who have paid a terrible price for backing him, Mr. Tsvangirai apparently decided the level of violence had become intolerable."",""The party also concluded that the systematic campaign to displace thousands of its poll workers had been so effective in the three vote-rich Mashonaland provinces, where Mr. Tsvangirai made strong inroads into Mr. Mugabe’s support, that they would be unable to staff the polling stations on election day, leaving them open to ballot-box stuffing."",""Mr. Tsvangirai, a charismatic former trade union leader who has been Mr. Mugabe’s hated rival for almost a decade, charged Sunday that the president’s violent, vengeful strategy had displaced 200,000 people, destroyed 20,000 homes and injured and maimed over 10,000 people in what he called “this orgy of violence.”"",""Sunday evening, downtown Harare was largely peaceful, with Mr. Tsvangirai’s supporters retreating home early, leaving the streets to pro-Mugabe brigades, chanting, “Win or war!”""]",nytimes.com/2008/06/23/world/africa/23zimbabwe,20-01-15 18:52

The party accused supporters of Dr. Ortom of masterminding the attack where one of the PDP youths was hit on the head."",""At a church service organized in honor of Rt. Honorable Orker Jev in Buruku local government area of the state, PDP youths allegedly invade the church, destroying not less than 10 vehicles belonging to the ex-member of the National Assembly."",""This incident was by the State commissioner of Police, Hyacinth Dagala, who also said four PDP youths were arrested in connection with the attack."",""Similarly in Makurdi last month, the campaign headquarters of Dr. Samuel Ortom and across the state were allegedly attack and vandalized by youths suspected to be loyal to the PDP."",""Two weeks ago in Adikpo, the headquarters of Kwande Local Government Area, three convoy vehicles belonging to the APC guber candidate, Dr. Samuel Ortom were vandalized, when he was delivering his funeral oration at the burial of Dr. Samson Sambe."",""Irked by the several attacks and counter attacks between the members of the two major parties in the state, Dr. Ortom  (APC) during a visit to the State Commissioner of Police, Hyacinth Dagala urged the commissioner to convene a roundtable of political stakeholders to dialogue and ensure peace in the state."",""Ortom alleged that since the beginning of the year, he has written to the state command complaining about the consistent attacks, but nothing has been done. He stated that the most disturbing aspect was the report that the police provided cover for some of the attacks."",""He however, warned his supporters against retaliation even as he said election should not be a do or die affairs."",""In response to the recent directive by the Inspector General of Police that all political parties and their candidates for the forth coming elections should be made to sign a peace pact, the state Commissioner of Police in collaboration with The Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) convened a peace signing meeting for candidates for the forthcoming election."",""Speaking at the event, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Dagala cautioned candidates against the dangers of possible break of violence at the forthcoming general elections and called for restraint."",""The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Benue state, Professor Istifanus Dafwang appealed to all political parties and their candidates contesting for elective offices to aver themselves to sign and abide by the tenets of the peace accord."",""He maintained that even as INEC is handy with all necessary materials, there was the need for stakeholders at the election and other members of the community to cooperate so as to avert violence at the elections."",""In his view, Majority Leader of the State Assembly, Mr. Paul Ibiam advised the police and other law enforcement agencies not to give any candidate undue protection to perpetuate violence at the election, but to play a neutral role to enhance fairness to all at the elections."",""Before signing the peace pact, Ortom urged INEC to ensure justice and fairness to all citizens at the election; insisting that election should not be a do or die affair."",""He also appealed to all other contestants to subject themselves to the peace accord and urged the security agents to ensure that there is level playing ground for all candidates, promising to ensure that members of APC abide by the tenets the peace pact."",""Similarly the running mate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Mr. John Ngbede promised to ensure that PDP members abide by the peace accord.""]",guardian.ng/politics/benue-records-pockets-of-pre-election-violence,13-03-15 20:00

We need our roads improved, we need health, water, electricity, employment.”"",""In a matching show of support, Muhammadu Buhari, Jonathan’s main challenger, was greeted by cheering crowds in Lagos a week earlier. Whenever it happens, the fourth election since the end of military rule in 1998 will be the biggest test of whether Africa’s most populous nation can hold democratic elections after decades of rule by the gun, bribery and intimidation."",""In 2011, the election was delayed twice, including once less than a week before the scheduled date. This time, with a week to go, 19 million of the 70 million registered voters have yet to collect their voting cards. A debate has raged over whether the electoral commission is prepared enough, with the incumbent party, which has greater access to Nigeria’s dwindling petrodollars, pushing for a postponement."",""In the north, where card collection has been high despite security concerns, Jonathan’s party has struggled most. Last month his convoy was attacked by young men with stones. “Even if you’re not as popular in some states, this was shocking,” an aide said."",""There have been other challenges. Oil prices have plunged to record lows, draining government coffers and leaving many civil servants unpaid for months. “The global economy has conspired against Jonathan. The momentum has moved so much against him, he can’t slow it,” said Rewane. Then there’s the Niger Delta, where militants once waged an insurgency that disrupted Africa’s biggest oil economy. That has been sidelined by the crisis hundreds of miles north, with Boko Haram killing 10,000 people in the past year."",""Ahead of Jonathan’s arrival, Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, a former militant leader, rode through the crowds, his fist raised in the air as he sat on a black Mercedes. His Niger Delta People’s Volunteer Force pushed oil prices to record highs in 2004 with attacks and threats against production in the delta’s swampy creeks. Since then, peace deals with the warlords, including a lucrative amnesty and government contracts, have pacified the area. An audit last week found at least $1.48bn (£1bn) had been siphoned from the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Company. A previous report by a respected former central bank governor put the figure at up to $20bn."",""“I know you love me and I love you,” said Jonathan, wearing his trademark fedora and carrying a gold-handled cane, in a speech punctuated by bass guitar and cymbals. “I will make sure that ­everybody, in one way or another, tastes the fruits of democracy.” His wife, Patience, led the rally with a song asking God to guarantee his victory."",""Elsewhere, the opposition’s slogan of change has resonated. Rather than turning it into a choice between two leaders, they have defined it as a choice between Jonathan or change. Many see no contradiction in that message, despite the fact that 72-year-old Buhari ruled Nigeria with an iron hand three decades ago."",""“For me, if it’s a choice between what we have today, which you can see is not working, and what we don’t know.

450494,DR Congo elections: A rumbling volcano,"[""The Democratic Republic of Congo’s long-delayed election may finally take place at the end of this year."",""Violence is inevitable and a return to chaos and breakdown is likely."",""Each election since 2006 has been controversial and violent. The problem is President Joseph Kabila, the son of Laurent Desire Kabila, the rebel leader who ousted Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997."",""The younger Kabila came to power at 29 when his father was assassinated in 2001. Though reticent, he initially impressed friend and foe alike. In a matter of months he replaced the late Kabila’s Cabinet with a youth team of technocrats; pensioned off his father’s power men in the armed forces; ended the DRC’s interminable wars; delivered a new constitution in 2005 and repaired relations with the international community."",""Soon he proved both venal and incompetent. His first elections in 2006 were contentious and violent. State media, the special police and other security forces were deployed to contain his opponents, forcing the veteran opposition leader, Etienne Tshisekedi, into a boycott."",""Kabila’s main rival, convicted warlord Jean Pierre Bemba disputed the results to no avail. Kabila appointed as minister of the presidency a former governor of Katanga region, Katumba Mwanke, an addicted deal maker who was soon selling hundred of millions of dollars worth of DRC’s mining rights for such low prices that some investors got back their money before the DRC got a penny."",""Five years later, in 2011, Kabila was re-elected for a second and, in theory, final term in another even more violent and disputatious election. Results from 2000 polling stations in Etienne Tshisekedi’s strongholds “got lost.” The DRC’s Roman Catholic bishops described the election as “treachery, lies and terror.”"",""Kabila’s term should have ended in 2016. However, in 2015 he had parliament pass a law that mandated a census to be done before any future election. His supporters promptly pushed for the 2016 election to be delayed until a census was done. Riots and protests followed."",""The Electoral Commission then postponed the elections to 2018, giving Kabila an unlawful two-year extension. In the meantime, the 2002 peace agreements had unravelled and the DRC’s rebel groups splintered further even as new ones emerged."",""As the country heads to elections later in the year, it is teetering on the precipice, again."",""Western governments have imposed sanctions on Kabila’s close advisors but these have not worked. The Catholic bishops tried and failed to find a settlement to the crisis."",""Mr Kabila has ignored the Saint Sylvester accord, the peace agreement the bishop brokered in 2016, setting a framework for dialogue; agree terms for presidential elections and foreclose any changes to give Kabila a third term."",""In the meantime, corruption has become a way of life, especially for the president’s friends and relatives. Some jaded Congolese, notes Jason Stearns in Dancing in the Glory of Monsters, even miss Mobutu."",""Mobutu, Stearns quotes one as saying, stole with a folk but Kabila steals with a spoon. With Mobutu some crumbs slipped through the cracks. Kabila’s twin sister, Jaynet Désiré Kabila Kyungu is leading “the charge of the eating brigade.”"",""She has been named in the Panama Papers as co-owner of Keratsu Holding Ltd, a 19 per cent owner of Congolese Wireless Network SPRL, which, in turn, holds a 49 per cent stake in Vodacom Congo SPRL, part of South Africa’s Vodacom Group."",""Last year, Vodacom SA reported that its customers in the DRC had grown by 21.8 per cent over the previous year to 10.4 million. The Kabilas are in the money."",""With the deck stacked this way, a peaceful election is unlikely. There are conflicts astir in many provinces, a fact tailor-made for Kabila’s schemes to derail the elections yet again."",""Treasury seeks additional funding of $866m, increasing the 2019/2020 budget to $30.4bn."",""Did you clear the university study loan you received from the Higher Education Loans Board""]",theeastafrican.co.ke/news/africa/DR-Congo-elections-A-rumbling-volcano/4552902-4339902-mpqb4n,12-03-18 20:00

But the decision was not unexpected: For weeks, the protesters who have filled the streets of Algiers and other cities have been demanding nothing less."",""The protesters deemed the planned elections illegitimate because they were engineered by the army and by politicians put in place by Algeria’s ousted leader, Abdelaziz Bouteflika."",""On Friday, demonstrators took to the streets for a 15th straight week."",""The elections were intended to fill the slot left vacant by Mr. Bouteflika’s forced resignation on April 2. But no serious candidates had presented themselves — and above all no candidates accepted by the Algerian street."",""The government ministers installed by the departing Mr. Bouteflika have so little credibility that they are often chased back into their cars by protesters when they try to make official visits."",""On Sunday, the country appeared to be at yet another impasse, with protesters and the army once again facing off and no immediate solution in sight."",""Algeria’s political leaders are discredited. Its military hierarchy, too, has been rejected by protesters clamoring for a complete break with the old army-dominated system of governance. And now there is no election scheduled."",""The Constitutional Council’s decision was merely a recognition of reality, analysts say: The protesters had already rejected the planned vote, and the army evidently decided not to impose one."",""“It’s significant,” said Hasni Abidi, a Swiss-Algerian political scientist at the Global Studies Institute of Geneva University. “The decision makers were faced with an impasse.

And Mr. Gaïd Salah is still pulling the strings."",""“What’s happened today is a victory for the people of Algeria, but it’s a victory with risk,” Mr. Abidi said."",""Abdelouahab Fersaoui, head of a leading civil society group, the Youth-Action Union, said: “It’s an important victory, but it’s not definitive.

35543,Controversy as INEC updates voters register,"[""An assessment of the preparedness of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to improve its ratings in conducting credible elections in Nigeria has been on the spotlight since April 27 when the umpire commenced the Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) across the country to update the national voters’ database which currently has about 70 million registered voters."",""The on-going process, which according to the electoral body, will be on until a few months before the 2019 general elections, is meant to capture Nigerians that are just attaining the voting age of 18 years and those who had not registered before or whose names could not be found in the register."",""It is also an opportunity for those registered voters who have damaged or lost their Permanent Voters Cards (PVC) and those who have not collected it before to do so while those who changed polling units because of movements can have the data updated in their new abodes."",""The essence of the exercise is to also create awareness of citizens’ civic responsibility and democratic rights and largely to absorb as many eligible Nigerian voters as possible so that the outcome of elections will reflect the wishes of the majority of the population."",""While launching the exercise last month in Abuja, INEC Chairman, Mahmud Yakubu said the commission was ready to expand the country’s voter population and sanitize the election process. He called on whistleblowers to identify and expose any registration of under-aged voters and foreigners while the exercise lasted."",""The commission’s Director of Voter Education and Publicity, Oluwole Osaze-Uzzi, had earlier announced that necessary logistics had been deployed for the exercise."",""He said, “The required personnel and materials for the exercise have been deployed. We have also trained our personnel who are going to be at our various LGA offices. We have tested and deployed our Direct Data Capturing Machine (DDCM) for the exercise to take off nationwide and our National Commissioners have gone out to the respective zones to monitor the registration.” "",""Claiming successes in the first three days of the exercise, INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee, Adedeji Soyebi said in a release that 57,737 people were registered with 4,913 collected PVCs. He also stated that within the short period, 1,820 individuals applied for transfer of Polling Units (PUs) while 1,117persons sought replacement of their lost or damaged PVCs.”"",""But if reports from the 36 states and Abuja, where the exercise is taking place in all the 774 local councils are anything to go by, the process may not be as smooth as the commission claimed in the first three days. "",""With this, the capability of INEC and ability of the political class to mobilize the people with the aim of increasing voter population and reinforce the election process, which is a major pillar of representative democracy, are being called to question. "",""Some of the complaints trailing the exercise include the failure and inadequate number of the Direct Data Capturing (DCC) machines in many designated points, long distance to registration centres and inability to handle the large number of prospective voters in some areas."",""Reports from Anambra where the governorship election will hold next November indicated that major stakeholders, while complaining about some of the hiccups, have appealed to INEC to focus attention on the state because of the nearness of the poll."",""Reacting yesterday, the National Chairman of deregistered National Transformation Party (NTP), Emmanuel Mok faulted the exercise saying it lacks the expected awareness and would probably place the northern region ahead of its southern counterpart in terms of voting strength in future elections."",""He said the exercise lacked the desired publicity and that “there are no centers other than where INEC is registering people quietly. The way the exercise is going, it would give undue advantage to the north against the south. This was part of our complaints in the previous exercise.”"",""He described as an aberration, the idea of carrying out the registration at local council secretariats and wondered how the crowd would be controlled “if all the people living in the Eti Osa Local Government decided to travel to the council for registration.”"",""Mok blamed INEC “for the lack of awareness because it is being funded by government for that purpose. The political parties that could have assisted in this area are no longer been funded by government.”"",""Also faulting the process, former National Secretary of Labour Party (LP), Kayode Ajulo said there is no adequate awareness for the exercise. According to him, “We complained of inadequate awareness of similar exercise in the past but for this one, there is zero awareness. "",""“Many Nigerians, particularly those in the south are not aware compared with their counterparts in the north. Some traditional rulers whom I spoke with in Ondo State are ignorant of the registration.”"",""He also pointed to the issue of weak opposition parties as a factor responsible for the poor awareness, saying that unlike when the ruling APC was in the opposition “there is no longer opposition forces to drive the exercise at present. The APC, because it is in power, is not doing much to ensure people come out to participate in the exercise.”"",""He claimed he did not observe any on-going registration during his visits across the country but that “INEC should not only be blamed as other stakeholders have their share of the fault.” "",""However, Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Adebayo Dayo said the exercise was going on well in the state but that the party is only worried “about information reaching us, and backed with facts, that under-age children are being registered throughout the northern region. INEC should be asked why the double different standard for the South and North in respect to same exercise.”"",""The party’s national spokesman, Benard Mikko who said they are yet to receive any concrete report on the exercise from field officers and that “we have directed our members and supporters to fully participate.”"",""Spokesman of the Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin said nothing enthusiastic has been seen regarding the registration because of people’s apathy to anything politics, politicians and election."",""According to him, “Nigerians are completely tired of politics because they feel that the present democratic system has not added any value to their living condition. If the exercise continues this way, definitely it will have negative effects on the next election and its credibility.”"",""He also said the capacity of the current electoral umpire to conduct free, fair and credible election in the country is a suspect as he urged that what the country needs now is to restructure the federation. "",""In his reaction to the plethora of allegations, spokesman of the electoral body, Rotimi Oyekanmi said “It is wrong for anybody to insinuate that the INEC is deliberately creating hiccups in the ongoing CVR exercise. "",""“On the contrary, our goal is to create the opportunity for qualified Nigerians, who have just clocked 18 years and all those who did not register in last CVR exercise and have also never registered to do so. "",""“The exercise will be truly continuous and will only be suspended two months to an election. However, we know that there may be some initial challenges, but they will be tackled gradually as we go along.”"",""He added, “There are no bottlenecks. But there is a procedure. All an intending registrant needs is some patience. However, where an INEC official has sufficient doubts about the age of an intending registrant, a form of identification to confirm date of birth may be required. This is to prevent an under-age person from registering.”"",""Oyekanmi also said it is not true that the DDC machines are nit functional or that they are not adequate, stressing, “There are enough machines and efforts are on to redeploy from where they are surplus to locations where they are not enough.” "",""Speaking on allegations of lack of enough awareness, he said, “The Commission did announce through several media channels ahead of time. Various stakeholders were also informed. This will continue. However, it is also the duty of the political parties to create awareness among their members on the need for them to register.”"",""He however declared frankly, “There will be no preference for any state because its election is near as there is ample time for eligible Nigerians in Anambra and other states to register.”""]",guardian.ng/politics/controversy-as-inec-updates-voters-register,11-05-17 20:00

Some 800 people were killed in protests in the predominantly Muslim north after 2011 elections when Jonathan beat former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari. Jonathan is a Christian from a minority tribe in the mainly Christian south. Buhari is a Muslim northerner."",""Both men are facing off again and supporters of both are threatening violence if their candidate does not win this year's contest, one analysts say is too close to call since opposition parties for the first time formed a coalition led by Buhari."",""A statement from Jonathan's party commended the postponement but blamed it on the commission, saying it is suffering \""numerous logistical problems and numerous internal challenges.\"""",""Buhari's coalition said it was holding an emergency meeting to discuss the implications of \""this major setback for Nigerian democracy.\"" It appealed to all Nigerians \""to remain calm and desist from violence.\"""",""Jega told reporters that national security advisers and intelligence officers have said security forces need six weeks to conduct \""a major operation\"" against Boko Haram and cannot also safeguard the elections."",""He said it would be \""highly irresponsible\"" to ignore that advice and endanger the lives and security of electoral personnel and materials, voters and observers as well as the prospects for free, fair and credible elections."",""Millions could be disenfranchised if Boko Haram continues to hold a large swath of the northeast and commit mayhem that has left 1.5 million people homeless."",""The postponement comes amid a major offensive against the exremists joined by Chad and Nigerian warplanes and ground troops that has driven the insurgents out of a dozen towns and villages in the past 10 days. Even stronger military strikes involving more neighboring countries are planned."",""African Union officials ended a three-day meeting Saturday in Yaounde, Cameroon's capital, finalizing details to deploy by next month an 8,750-strong force from Nigeria and its four neighbors to combat the growing regional threat posed by Boko Haram."",""Nigeria's home-grown extremist group has responded with attacks on one town in Cameroon and two in Niger this week. Officials said more than 100 civilians were killed and 500 wounded in Cameroon. Niger said about 100 insurgents and one civilian died in attacks Friday. Several security forces from both countries were killed."",""The insurgents also have launched three attacks within a week on Maiduguri, the biggest city in the northeast, which thousands of people were fleeing Saturday, overcrowding buses, trucks and cars with bodies and belongings."",""\""We fear the violence that could erupt during the elections more than the threats of Boko Haram,\"" said Mojo Okechukwu, a 45-year-old vehicle spare parts dealer and Christian from the south who has lived in Maiduguri for 20 years."",""International concern has increased along with the death toll: Some 10,000 killed in the uprising in the past year compared to 2,000 in the four previous years, according to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations."",""The United States had been urging Nigeria to press ahead with the voting. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria two weeks ago and said that \""one of the best ways to fight back against Boko Haram\"" was by holding credible and peaceful elections, on time."",""\""It's imperative that these elections happen on time as scheduled,\"" Kerry said."",""The elections had been called early. Elections in 2011 were postponed until April. May 29 is the deadline for a new government to be installed."",""The postponement also will give the commission a chance to deliver more voter cards: Jega said that by Friday, only 45.8 million of the 68.8 million cards needed to vote had been collected. Nigeria does not have a working postal service, though it has Africa's biggest economy."",""Jonathan's party has won every election since decades of military rule ended in 1999.
