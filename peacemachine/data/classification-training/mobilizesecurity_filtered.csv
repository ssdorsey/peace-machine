There is no real alternative; the future is not bright for Burundi on its current trajectory.”"",""He also strongly suggested that discussions should be held outside of Burundi despite President Nkurunziza’s disapproval, arguing that some key participants are “scared to go back to Burundi” — including opposition leaders and members of Nkurunziza’s party who fled."",""The guide will help developing countries navigate the digital age."",""Treasury seeks additional funding of $866m, increasing the 2019/2020 budget to $30.4bn.""]",theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/AU-set-to-send-5-000-troops-to-stop-Burundi-bloodshed--/4552908-3002656-gvourgz

Two suffered serious gunshot wounds."",""“This barbaric crime is totally unacceptable and those responsible must answer for their actions,” Albert Koenders, the head of MINUSMA, said of the killings in the governor’s office. “An inquiry must be carried out quickly in order to verify the facts and bring the responsible parties to justice.”"",""A spokesman for the MNLA, which claimed control of Kidal on Sunday, had earlier said the rebels were preparing to hand over the government workers they were holding."",""“There were no murders,” Attaye Ag Mohamed told Reuters by telephone from the town. “Those killed at the governor’s office were killed in the exchange of gunfire or mortar explosions.”"",""He said the MNLA was also holding 15 soldiers it considered to be prisoners of war."",""Malian forces suffered 25 wounded in addition to the eight dead, according to the Defense Ministry, while 28 attackers were killed and 62 wounded."",""A Malian military source said Saturday’s gun battle erupted after MNLA fighters in two trucks attacked an army checkpoint in front of the governor’s office."",""The MNLA’s Ag Mohamed rejected the government’s version of Saturday’s events and said the army attacked first, opening fire on the group’s barracks following pro-independence protests in the town."",""He said the rebels had killed 19 government soldiers and suffered no losses of their own."",""“The situation is calm right now.

0,"Nigerian president says African Union ready to send up to 5,000 troops but needs hundreds of millions of dollars","[""NEW YORK (AP) - The African Union can quickly mobilize up to 5,000 troops to help end the looting and killing in western Sudan, but it needs hundreds of millions of dollars to deploy the force, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has said.  "",""\""The troops are ready,\"" said Obasanjo, president of the 53-nation regional bloc. \""The first pledge which we got was from Canada,\"" which contributed US$20 million on Wednesday, he said, but the vastly expanded force now requires \""hundreds of millions.\""  "",""In an interview Wednesday night, Obasanjo expressed hope that the United States will be generous in helping Sudan's conflict-wracked Darfur region.  "",""On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution strongly endorsing the deployment of a beefed-up African Union force with an expanded monitoring mission that would try to prevent attacks and mediate to stop the conflict from escalating. It threatens oil sanctions if the government doesn't move quickly to help stop the attacks.  "",""The resolution \""will caution the government of Sudan to know that the world is not just folding its hands looking -- and that the Sudanese government cannot do what it likes,\"" Obasanjo said.  "",""\""The internal affairs of every country today is the concern of the international community and more so, in Africa, the concern of the AU,\"" he said.  "",""The African Union has about 80 military observers in Darfur -- a region about the size of France -- protected by just over 300 soldiers, monitoring a rarely observed cease-fire signed in April by the government and rebels.  "",""The conflict began when two Darfur rebel groups with roots in the region's ethnic African tribes rose up in February 2003, accusing the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum of neglect and discrimination. The government is accused of trying to suppress the rebellion by backing ethnic Arab herdsmen known as Janjaweed.  "",""During the past 19 months, over 50,000 people have been killed, dozens of villages have been burned, and more than 1.2 million people have fled their homes. The United Nations calls it the world's worst humanitarian crisis and the U.S. Congress has called it genocide, a label Obasanjo disagrees with because he does not see deliberate targeting of a religious, racial or ethnic group.  "",""The Nigerian leader also vehemently disagreed with reports that peace talks between the government and rebels which he has been hosting in the capital, Abuja, had broken down.  "",""The parties have agreed on a month-long recess and when they return they will sign a humanitarian protocol, then tackle security issues, and eventually head on to the difficult issue of political arrangements for a permanent solution to the Darfur problem, he said.  "",""Asked whether he was confident of this scenario, Obasanjo said, \""That's what's going to happen.\""  "",""\""It's their position that nobody will walk away (from the peace talks) without solving the problem, so you cannot say it broke down,\"" he said.  "",""Initially, Obasanjo said, the Sudanese government believed \""it could cope\"" with the Darfur crisis, but it now recognizes that it cannot cope and \""opened its hand for assistance to allow more AU protection force to come in.\""  "",""The small force now on the ground to protect the military observers will be greatly expanded with a broader role, he said.  "",""\""We need to really ensure that the Janjaweed and those opposed to the government of Sudan who have taken up arms have to be separated -- and to separate them and keep them separated you need more than just an observer team,\"" Obasanjo said.  "",""\""We need between 3,000 and 5,000 troops to carry out protection of the observer team, of the force itself,\"" he said.  "",""Obasanjo had no complaints about the financial support for the small AU force currently in Darfur. But to deploy thousands of additional troops requires hundreds of thousands of dollars, and until the money and equipment to move, equip and support the expanded force arrives, the soldiers can't deploy, he said.  "",""Earlier Wednesday, African Union Commission Chairman Alpha Oumar Konare told The Associated Press that troop movement depends on logistical help from \""Europe, America and the United Nations especially.\""  "",""So far, he said, there has been just talk about assistance.  "",""He said Nigeria, Rwanda and Tanzania are ready to contribute troops, \""but we don't have the means\"" to move and equip them.  "",""Obasanjo said he asked the Nigerian Senate for two battalions, though he hopes only one will be needed, and he expressed hope that other countries would also make contributions.

0,Somali leaders and elders join calls against Amisom troop withdrawal,"[""The leadership of the African Union Mission in Somalia has started implementing the transition plan to reduce troop numbers gradually and hand over to the Somali National Army by 2021."",""However, elders and chiefs want the process delayed, citing their military’s limitations to contain and fight off the Al Shabaab threat."",""The elders’ fears echo those of the force commanders that have questioned the practicability of the UN Security Council Resolution 2372, which last year directed that Amisom commence a force drawdown."",""Accordingly, last October, the Amisom which was 22,000-strong reduced the force by 1,000 soldiers, with a similar number set to leave in October this year."",""But with Al Shabaab still lurking in the shadows and making deadly forays into the capital as well as Amisom bases and executing deadly attacks, the locals warn that the drawdown is too soon as the SNA alone cannot contain the insurgents."",""Operational capacity"",""Even now, local communities in Lower Shabelle region report that Al Shabaab operate from as close as five kilometres from Amisom bases, and the peacekeeping force’s withdrawal would leave communities exposed to attack."",""“If Amisom were to leave now, Al Shabaab would capture the entire place in one minute, just one minute,” says Moulid Abdirahman, a Somali national and intelligence officer who has worked closely with the peacekeepers for the last 10 years."",""Nuur Osman Raage, the District Commissioner of Marka also says that before issuing a directive to whittle down Amisom, the UN should take into account the security concerns of the Somalis who want “Amisom to drive Al Shabaab farther away from our area.”"",""Other elders lay the blame on their government. “Our president stays in Mogadishu and has never come here. That is a fact. This place is peaceful because of Amisom,” says Abdukadir Mohamed from Ceeljaale village, about 71km southwest of the capital."",""Brig Gen Paul Lokech, Commander of the Ugandan contingent in Amisom says force commanders share the Somalis’ fears that the SNA is still short on numbers, organisation and operational capacity to take over the areas that are currently under the peacekeeping force’s protection."",""“In every war there is transition, but from a military lens, we need to prepare the SNA. Are they ready? Yes, they are being trained, but it is a process. People calling for a drawdown need to handle it carefully,” he told a group of journalists at his offices in Mogadishu recently."",""The bulk of the SNA was trained in Uganda, but these number about 4,000 soldiers only. The SNA is beefed up by allied clan militia, but it is still is short on numbers, command and control to man the regions that Amisom has liberated."",""“Getting fighters is easy, but how do you command and control them? Do not forget that we are building an army while fighting insurgents at the same time. The Somali army officers need more preparation,” Brig Gen Lokech said."",""“We still need to train Somali officer corps to handle the job at hand. There are 75 Somalis currently on officer cadet training in Uganda. We need a lot more effort in organising the SNA,” he added."",""Other key partners training the Somalis, are the European Union, the US."",""Also, the Turkish training academy recently graduated one company (between 80 and 150 soldiers), while the United Arab Emirates passed out 900 soldiers."",""Guerrilla-style attacks"",""Since 2011, the Al Shabaab militia that was operating in Afgooye — just 30km from Mogadishu — has been driven further out, forcing the insurgents to resort to guerrilla-style tactics against the Amisom."",""To regain lost territory, Al Shabaab could launch attacks against SNA to take back the regions currently under Amisom — if the latter left any vacuum in the sectors it controls. These are Sector I which includes the special region of Banadir (including Mogadishu) and Lower Shabelle, manned by Ugandans; Sector II is Lower and Middle Jubba under Kenya Defence Forces and Sector III that comprise the South Western states under Ethiopian forces."",""The others are Sector IV in Hiiran region under Djibouti forces, Sector V in Middle Shabelle covered by Burundi and Sector VI which is part of Jubbaland, manned by a multinational force from different troop contributing countries."",""Damning report"",""Sector I alone has 5,700 soldiers — more than one-third of the entire SNA — under battle groups XXII, XXIII, and XXIV."",""Critically, Battle Group XXIV deploys and guards key security and strategic installations like the airport, the seaport, the UN agencies, the Federal Government of Somalia headquarters, State House, Parliament, embassy headquarters, Al Jazeera Training School and the capital."",""Somalia also has a 3,000km coastline — a strategic feature for the Al Shabaab to exploit and launch attacks."",""Securing the coastline is an uphill task for the SNA which is estimated to have about 15,000 soldiers, but 30 per cent of whom are unarmed — which was a damning finding of an “Operational Readiness Assessment” that was released by the Somali government last December."",""According to Lt. Col Fred Mwesigye, the Commandant of the First Infantry Battalion headquartered at Shalamboot, “the headquarters” of Al Shabaab in the town of Janaale in Lower Shabelle region, is not far away from the coastline."",""“This is an enemy infested area… their headquarters is just 8km from here. I am not scaring you, but that’s the situation,” he told a group of embedded journalists from Uganda, that recently toured the forward operating bases of the largest contingent of the AU peacekeeping force."",""Apparently, Sector VI also still requires heavy deployment, which is part of Jubbaland and is patrolled by the multinational force under Burundi’s Brig Gen Fréderic Ndayisaba."",""This is the smallest of the areas where Amisom deploys, covering only 20,000 km2, but it has the biggest Al Shabaab presence, according to the force spokesperson Lt Col Richard Omwega."",""Amisom was created by the Peace and Security Council of the African Union in January 2007, as a peacekeeping force in the war-torn Horn of Africa country, initially with a six month mandate, which was subsequently renewed and extended."",""The mission landed the first boots on Somali soil in March 2007 from Uganda, followed by Burundi."",""Eleven years later, the force which now includes Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti — is working toward its exit."",""Still, questions remain as to how this transition will be implemented, and whether withdrawal as directed by the UNSC is achievable."",""“There are certain areas we can’t leave,” says the Amisom spokesman Lt Col Omwega."",""“We met the SNA and sector commanders recently and agreed that our exit is conditional depending on the prevailing security situation.”"",""Exporting nations cited for exceeding allowable levels of chemicals in fresh farm produce."",""Its unpredictable flooding swallows crops and houses as it crashes through Sudan on its way to""]",theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Somali-leaders-against-Amisom-troop-withdrawal-/4552908-4558354-ry0obmz

It ended with an agreement by both governments to allow an international commission to decide where the border will be, particularly in relation to the disputed town of Badme, where the fighting began."",""In 2002, the border commission gave Badme to Eritrea, a decision that Ethiopia has refused to accept."",""Last month, after Eritrea banned United Nations helicopters from its airspace and the two countries moved troops closer to the border, the Security Council threatened economic and diplomatic sanctions if they returned to war. Eritrea denounced the resolution and criticized Security Council members for not threatening Ethiopia with sanctions if it failed to agree to the new border."",""United Nations officials said they reacted swiftly on Wednesday because they viewed the Eritrean move as a challenge to the basic concept of peacekeeping. \""The essence of a peacekeeping operation is that the international community as a whole is standing together, and that principle has wide-ranging implications that go beyond the specific Ethiopia-Eritrea mission,\"" said Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the under secretary general for peacekeeping.""]",nytimes.com/2005/12/08/world/africa/eritrea-expels-un-peacekeepers-increasing-tension-with
